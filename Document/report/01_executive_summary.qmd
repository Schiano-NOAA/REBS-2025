# Executive Summary

## Stock
This assessment reports the status of the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes that reside in the waters off California, Oregon, and Washington from the U.S.- Canadian border in the north to the U.S.-Mexico border in the south.

These two species are difficult to consistently differentiate visually in the catch, thus they are commonly reported and treated as one management complex. Despite recent advances in species identification of`r Spp` as genetically distinct species, there is still little ability to reliably separate historical fishery data in order to differentiate these two species into two stocks. While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses.

## Catches
`r Spp` are not targeted by a specific fishery, but are desirable and marketable, thus are typically retained when caught.

The historical reconstruction of landings for `r Spp` suggests that non-trawl (largely hook and line gear) fisheries have caught `r Spp`  since the turn of the 20th century and landings in the trawl fishery are estimated to have increased into the 1940’s. Landings remained relatively constant throughout the 1950’s and into the 1960’s before the foreign trawl fleet targeting Pacific Ocean perch increased catches into the 1970’s. The declaration of the exclusive economic zone resulted in the buildup of a domestic fleet and landings increased rapidly into the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.  Subsequently, landings declined in the late 1990’s. `r Spp` has long been bycaught in the fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake, which is almost exclusively conducted with mid-water trawls. In recent years, contribution of the mid-water trawl catches within shoreside trawl landings gradually grew and in most recent year and now they represent majority of the trawl removals. Time series of landings are shown @fig-es-landings, with recent landings detailed in @tbl-es-catches.

`r Spp` are a desirable market species and discarding has been low, historically.  However, management restrictions (e.g., trip limits) have resulted in increased discarding since early 2000s.  Trawl rationalization was introduced in 2011, and since then very little discarding of `r Spp` has occurred.

### Data and Assessments
The only previous stock assessment for `r spp` for the U.S. West Coast area was done in 2013 [@hicks_status_2013]. This assessment uses Stock Synthesis statistical catch-at-age modelling framework [@MethotWetzel2013], version 3.30.23.1.The modeling period begins in 1892, and the stock prior to that is assumed to be in an unfished equilibrium condition.

`r Spp` fishery-dependent data in this assessment are divided among six fleets, treating discard catches separately from the retained fisheries. Following 2013 assessment, it maintains the at-sea-hake fishery as its own fleet, and adds a mid-water fishery that has emerged in the last 10 years. This stock assessment adds 10+ years of additional length data, and adds several more years of age data (included as conditioned on length data). The same four surveys (the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS), AFSC/NWFSC Triennial Shelf Survey, AFSC Slope Survey and NWFSC Slope Survey) as used in the last stock assessment are used here, with an extension to 2024 to the the WCGBTS. The index standardization of all survey data uses the newer approach of applying spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models. 

This is a sex-specific model. Females and males have separate growth curves and sex-specific weight-at-length parameters. Growth is assumed to follow the von Bertalanffy growth model, and the assessment explicitly estimates all parameters describing somatic growth. The model assumes a natural mortality of 0.036 yr-1 for males, while natural mortality for females is estimated using a meta-analytical prior (@hamel_development_2022).  Externally estimated life history parameters, including those defining the length-weight relationship, female fecundity and maturity schedule were revised for this assessment to incorporate new information. Recruitment dynamics are assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, and recruitment deviations are estimated. Stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the value generated from meta-analytical study. The base model estimates parameters for selectivity based on length data, and estimated selectivity curves are a mix of dome-shaped (for bottom trawl gears) and logistic (for mid-water gears).

### Stock Output and Dynamics
The model estimates that the stock complex did not exhibit a sharp changes throughout the years (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl) and currently is in a healthy state, well above management target. Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is high. Estimates of spawning biomass in most recent decade are shown in @tbl-es-sb. 

Fraction unfished shows more resolution in stock dynamics, with slight decline in the 1960s, subsequent increase through the early-1980s, following another decrease over the past forty five years.

## Recruitment
The estimated largest recruitment event throughout the time series was in 2008, which supported an increase in the population leading up to 2017 (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits). Recruitment is estimated to be relatively low in the later 2010s, but the model estimates that 2021 and 2023 may support large year classes in the future, with the estimates driven by the new recruitment index for both years.

## Exploitation Status
Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a spawning potential ratio of 0.5 throughout the entire time series. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to restrictive trip limits. As with catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017, have remained stable since then, and are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).

## Ecosysystem Consideration
The assessment includes a sensitivity model with an oceanographic recruitment index. A number of ecosystem and environmental conditions were compiled by a team of ecosystem scientists at the NWFSC specific to the life history and distribution of northern yellowtail. These conditions included an evaluation of oceanographic conditions impacting recruitment, habitat change, prey availability, predator and competitor abundance, and climate vulnerability. 


## Reference Points
A list of estimates of the current state of the population, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) a spawning potential ratio of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es. SPR, or the spawning potential ratio, is the fraction of expected lifetime reproductive output under a given fishing intensity divided by unfished expected lifetime reproductive output.

## Management Performance
Although catch increased substantially in 2017, it has still been well below the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit (@tbl-es-management). Attainment of the OFL has averaged around 50\% since the increase in landings, and was even lower in prior years.

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty
The largest uncertainty in this model is the inability to fit a marked increase in the bottom trawl survey from 2014-2019. This coincides with an increase in catch-per-unit-effort from the midwater trawl fishery (which accounts for the majority of landings). The increase is likely due to the record 2008 year class, but the estimated size of the year class does not lead to a large enough increase to fit the survey index, and it is especially hard to fit the sudden decrease and then flattening of the index, given the estimated natural mortality rate and that catches were relatively stable from 2017-2024. The current assessment estimates that the stock is more depleted than it was in 2017, the time of the last assessment, which is likely the case. The magnitude of that difference is more uncertain.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
Projections of the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a P* of 0.45 and a log-space standard deviation of the overfishing limit of 0.5 are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the acceptable biological catch.
