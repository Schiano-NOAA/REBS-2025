# Executive Summary

## Stock
This assessment reports the status of the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes that reside in the waters off California, Oregon, and Washington from the U.S.- Canadian border in the north to the U.S.-Mexico border in the south.

These two species are difficult to consistently differentiate visually in the catch, thus they are commonly reported and treated as one management complex. Despite recent advances in species identification of`r Spp` as genetically distinct species, there is still little ability to reliably separate historical fishery data in order to differentiate these two species into two stocks. While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses.

## Catches
`r Spp` are not targeted by a specific fishery, but are desirable and marketable, thus are typically retained when caught.

The historical reconstruction of landings for `r Spp` suggests that non-trawl (largely hook and line gear) fisheries have caught `r Spp`  since the turn of the 20th century and landings in the trawl fishery are estimated to have increased into the 1940’s. Landings remained relatively constant throughout the 1950’s and into the 1960’s before the foreign trawl fleet targeting Pacific Ocean perch increased catches into the 1970’s. The declaration of the exclusive economic zone resulted in the buildup of a domestic fleet and landings increased rapidly into the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.  Subsequently, landings declined in the late 1990’s. `r Spp` has long been bycaught in the fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake, which is almost exclusively conducted with mid-water trawls. In recent years, contribution of the mid-water trawl catches within shoreside trawl landings gradually grew and in most recent year and now they represent majority of the trawl removals. Time series of landings are shown @fig-es-landings, with recent landings detailed in @tbl-es-catches.

`r Spp` are a desirable market species and discarding has been low, historically.  However, management restrictions (e.g., trip limits) have resulted in increased discarding since early 2000s.  Trawl rationalization was introduced in 2011, and since then very little discarding of `r Spp` has occurred.

### Data and Assessments
The only previous stock assessment for `r spp` for the U.S. West Coast area was done in 2013 [@hicks_status_2013]. This assessment uses Stock Synthesis statistical catch-at-age modelling framework [@MethotWetzel2013], version 3.30.23.1.The modeling period begins in 1892, and the stock prior to that is assumed to be in an unfished equilibrium condition.

`r Spp` fishery-dependent data in this assessment are divided among six fleets, treating discard catches separately from the retained fisheries. Following 2013 assessment, it maintains the at-sea-hake fishery as its own fleet, and adds a mid-water fishery that has emerged in the last 10 years. This stock assessment adds 10+ years of additional length data, and adds several more years of age data (included as conditioned on length data). The same four surveys (the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS), AFSC/NWFSC Triennial Shelf Survey, AFSC Slope Survey and NWFSC Slope Survey) as used in the last stock assessment are used here, with an extension to 2024 to the the WCGBTS. The index standardization of all survey data uses the newer approach of applying spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models. 

This is a sex-specific model. Females and males have separate growth curves and sex-specific weight-at-length parameters. Growth is assumed to follow the von Bertalanffy growth model, and the assessment explicitly estimates all parameters describing somatic growth. The natural mortality for females is estimated in the assessment and natural mortality for males is fixed an the value generated from meta-analytical study.  Externally estimated life history parameters, including those defining the length-weight relationship, female fecundity and maturity schedule were revised for this assessment to incorporate new information. Recruitment dynamics are assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, and recruitment deviations are estimated. Stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the value generated from meta-analytical study. The base model estimates parameters for selectivity based on length data, and estimated selectivity curves are a mix of dome-shaped (for bottom trawl gears) and logistic (for mid-water gears).

### Stock Output and Dynamics
The model estimates that the stock complex did not exhibit a sharp changes throughout the years (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl) and currently is in a healthy state, well above management target. Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is high. Estimates of spawning biomass in most recent decade are shown in @tbl-es-sb. 

Fraction unfished shows more resolution in stock dynamics, with slight decline in the 1960s, subsequent increase through the early-1980s, following another decrease over the past forty five years.

## Recruitment
Recruitment dynamics (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits) are assumed to follow Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function and the steepness parameter was fixed at the value of 0.72, which is the mean of steepness prior probability distribution, derived from meta-analysis of rockfish stocks. The level of virgin recruitment (R0) is estimated to inform the magnitude of the initial stock size. Annual recruitment is treated as stochastic. “Main” recruitment deviations were estimated for modeled years between 1892 and 2023.

## Exploitation Status
Two measures of exploitation are fishing intensity and exploitation rate. Fishing intensity is defined here as 1 - SPR, where SPR is the equilibrium spawning output at a given combination of F and selectivity relative to spawning output at unfished equilibrium. Using the units of 1-SPR means that more intense fishing is associated with a higher value. The value of 1-SPR in the absence of fishing is 0 and the maximum is 1.0 if all spawning fish are being killed before spawning. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has chosen an SPR target of 0.5 for 'r Spp' so harvest which leads to SPR below 0.5, or fishing intensity (1-SPR) greater than 0.7 would be overfishing. Exploitation rate is defined as the catch relative to age 3+ biomass. This metric is included because interpretation is simple, but it is not used as a basis for management.

Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a spawning potential ratio of 0.5 throughout the entire time series. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to restrictive trip limits. As with catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017, have remained stable since then, and are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).

## Exploitation Status
Two measures of exploitation are fishing intensity and exploitation rate. Fishing intensity is defined here as 1 - SPR, where SPR (Spawning Potential Ratio) is the equilibrium spawning output at a given combination of F and selectivity relative to spawning output at unfished equilibrium. Using the units of 1-SPR means that more intense fishing is associated with a higher value. The value of 1-SPR in the absence of fishing is 0 and the maximum is 1.0 if all spawning fish are being killed before spawning. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has chosen an SPR target of 0.5 for `r spp` so harvest which leads to SPR below 0.5, or fishing intensity (1-SPR) greater than 0.5 would be overfishing. Exploitation rate is defined as the catch relative to age 26+ biomass. This metric is included because interpretation is simple, but it is not used as a basis for management.

Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a SPR of 0.5 throughout the entire time series (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).

## Ecosysystem Consideration
Rockfishes are an important component of the California Current ecosystem along the U.S. West Coast, with its many dozens of species filling various niches in both soft and hard bottom habitats from the nearshore to the continental slope. `r spp` are one of the larger species of rockfishes and occupy shelf areas when they are young and move into deeper slope waters with age.  As they age, they tend to become more solitary, but may form aggregations during the spawning season.  Due to a paucity of life-history data for `r spp`, most ecosystem considerations are implied from the understanding of rockfishes in general.

Recruitment is one mechanism by which the ecosystem may directly impact the population dynamics of `r spp`. The specific pathways through which environmental conditions exert influence on `r spp` dynamics are unclear, however, changes in water temperature and currents, distribution of prey and predators, and the amount and timing of upwelling are all possible linkages.  Changes in the environment may also result in changes in age-at-maturity, fecundity, growth, and survival which can affect how the status of the stock and its susceptibility to fishing are determined.  Unfortunately, there are no data for `r spp` that provide insights into these effects.

## Reference Points
A list of estimates of the current state of the population, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) a spawning potential ratio of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es. 

Unfished spawning stock output for `r spp` is estimated to be 5,647,660 eggs (95% confidence interval: 0–12,581,189 eggs). The management biomass target for `r spp` is defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output (𝐵40%), which is estimated by the model to be 2,259,070 eggs (95% confidence interval: 0– 5,032,478 eggs), which corresponds, in a theoretical equilibrium state, to an exploitation rate (catch / age 26+ biomass) of 0.048. This harvest rate provides an equilibrium yield of 553 mt at 𝐵40% (95% confidence interval: 0–1,224 mt). Catch limits are determined by an SPR = 50% reference point which is associated with equilibrium exploitation rate of 0.040. The model estimate of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is 592 mt (95% confidence interval: 0–1,311  mt). The estimated spawning stock output at MSY is 1,497,160 eggs (95% confidence interval: 0–3,337,633eggs). The exploitation rate corresponding to the estimated FMSY proxy of SPR = 34% is 0.085.

## Management Performance
Although catch increased substantially in 2017, it has still been well below the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit (@tbl-es-management). Attainment of the OFL has averaged around 50\% since the increase in landings, and was even lower in prior years.

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties
`r spp` are one of the longest lived species of rockfish on the West Coast and therefore natural mortality is likely to be lower than for other rockfish species. This assessment attempts to capture that uncertainty by estimating natural mortality for females and integrating that uncertainty into the derived biomass estimates, but also balance it with using meta-analytical prior of maximum age-based natural mortality by fixing the male natural mortality .

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
Projections of the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a P* of 0.45 and a log-space standard deviation of the overfishing limit of 0.5 are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the acceptable biological catch.

No decision table needed in draft assessments undergoing review.

#Scientific Uncertainty
The model estimated uncertainty around the 2025 spawning output for is 𝜎 = XX. The uncertainty around the OFL is 𝜎 = XX. These 𝜎 values surely underestimate the overall uncertainty as they do not incorporate the model structural uncertainty and do not account for any time-varying dynamics other than recruitment.The estimated uncertainty values are lower than the Category 1 default 𝜎=0.5, so all projections will use the default 𝜎.
