# Executive Summary

## Stock
This assessment reports the status of the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes that reside in the waters off California, Oregon, and Washington from the U.S.- Canadian border in the north to the U.S.-Mexico border in the south.

These two species are difficult to differentiate visually in the catch, thus they are commonly reported and treated as one management complex. Despite recent advances in species identification of `r Spp` as genetically distinct species, there is still little ability to reliably separate historical fishery data in order to differentiate these two species into two stocks. Therefore, this assessment maintains a species complex approach, though given absolute presence off the U.S. West Coast, this may be considered more of a Rougheye than Blackspotted Rockfish stock assessment. While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses.

## Catches
`r Spp` are not targeted by a specific fishery, but are desirable and marketable, thus are typically retained when caught.

The historical reconstruction of landings for `r Spp` suggests that non-trawl (largely hook-and-line gear) fisheries have caught `r Spp`  since the turn of the 20th century. The bottom trawl fishery developed in the 1930s and 1940s, and trawl landings for `r Spp` first peaked in the 1960’s and 1970s, when the foreign trawl fleet was targeting Pacific Ocean perch. The declaration of the Exclusive Economic Zone resulted in the buildup of a domestic fleet and landings increased rapidly into the late 1980’s and early 1990’s.  Subsequently, landings declined in the late 1990’s, with catches under 250 metric tons in the last two decades. The contribution of mid-water trawl catches gradually grew over the past 15 years, and now they represent majority of the trawl removals.

Since `r Spp` are a desirable market species, discarding has been low historically.  However, management restrictions (e.g., trip limits) have resulted in increased discarding since early 2000s.  Trawl rationalization was introduced in 2011, and since then very little discarding of `r Spp` has occurred. 

`r Spp` also has long been bycaught in the fishery for the coastal population of Pacific hake, which is almost exclusively conducted with mid-water trawl. 

Time series of landings are shown @fig-es-landings, with recent landings detailed in @tbl-es-catches.

## Data and Assessments
The only previous benchmark stock assessment for `r spp` for the U.S. West Coast area was done in 2013 [@hicks_status_2013]. It was conducted with Stock Synthesis statistical catch-at-age modelling framework [@MethotWetzel2013].

This 2025 assessment also uses Stock Synthesis, version 3.30.23.1. The modeling period begins in 1892, and the stock prior to that is assumed to be in an unfished equilibrium condition.

`r Spp` fishery-dependent data in this assessment are divided among six fleets, treating discard catches separately from the retained fisheries. Following 2013 assessment, it maintains the at-sea-hake fishery as its own fleet, and adds a mid-water fishery that has emerged in the last decade. This stock assessment adds 10+ years of additional length data, and several more years of age data (included as conditioned on length data). The same four surveys (the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS), AFSC/NWFSC Triennial Shelf Survey, AFSC Slope Survey and NWFSC Slope Survey) as used in the last stock assessment are used here, with an extension to 2024 to the the WCGBTS. The index standardization of all survey data uses the newer approach of applying spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models. 

This is a sex-specific model. Females and males have separate growth curves and sex-specific weight-at-length parameters. Growth is assumed to follow the von Bertalanffy growth model, and the assessment explicitly estimates all parameters describing somatic growth. The natural mortality for females is estimated in the assessment and natural mortality for males is fixed an the value generated from meta-analytical study.  Externally estimated life history parameters, including those defining the length-weight relationship, female fecundity and maturity schedule were revised for this assessment to incorporate new information. Recruitment dynamics are assumed to follow the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function, and recruitment deviations are estimated. Stock-recruitment steepness is fixed at the value generated from meta-analytical study. The base model estimates parameters for selectivity based on length data, and estimated selectivity curves are a mix of dome-shaped (for bottom trawl gears) and logistic (for mid-water trawl).

## Stock Output and Dynamics
The model estimates that the stock complex currently is in a healthy state, well above management target (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is high. Estimates of spawning biomass in most recent decade are shown in @tbl-es-sb. 

Fraction unfished shows slight decline between 1940s and the 1960s, also also gradual decline since early-1980s, which correspond to catch history.

## Recruitment
Recruitment dynamics (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits) are assumed to follow Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function and the steepness parameter was fixed at the value of 0.72, which is the mean of steepness prior probability distribution, derived from meta-analysis of rockfish stocks. The level of virgin recruitment (R0) is estimated to inform the magnitude of the initial stock size. Annual recruitment is treated as stochastic. “Main” recruitment deviations were estimated for modeled years between 1892 and 2023, with forecast recruitment period starting in 2024 (@fig-es-recdevs).

## Exploitation Status
Two measures of exploitation are fishing intensity and exploitation rate. Fishing intensity is defined here as 1 - SPR, where SPR (Spawning Potential Ratio) is the equilibrium spawning output at a given combination of F and selectivity relative to spawning output at unfished equilibrium. Using the units of 1-SPR means that more intense fishing is associated with a higher value. The value of 1-SPR in the absence of fishing is 0 and the maximum is 1.0 if all spawning fish are being killed before spawning. The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) has chosen an SPR target of 0.5 for `r spp` so harvest which leads to SPR below 0.5, or fishing intensity (1-SPR) greater than 0.5 would be overfishing. Exploitation rate is defined as the catch relative to age 26+ biomass. This metric is included because interpretation is simple, but it is not used as a basis for management.

Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a SPR of 0.5 throughout most of the time series except for 1995, when the catch peaked at 744 metric tons (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-spr).

## Ecosysystem Consideration
Rockfishes are an important component of the California Current ecosystem along the U.S. West Coast, with its many dozens of species filling various niches in both soft and hard bottom habitats from the nearshore to the continental slope. `r spp` are one of the larger species of rockfishes and occupy shelf areas when they are young and move into deeper slope waters with age.  As they age, they tend to become more solitary, but may form aggregations during the spawning season.  Due to a paucity of life-history data for `r spp`, most ecosystem considerations are implied from the understanding of rockfishes in general.

Recruitment is one mechanism by which the ecosystem may directly impact the population dynamics of `r spp`. The specific pathways through which environmental conditions exert influence on `r spp` dynamics are unclear, however, changes in water temperature and currents, distribution of prey and predators, and the amount and timing of upwelling are all possible linkages.  Changes in the environment may also result in changes in age-at-maturity, fecundity, growth, and survival which can affect how the status of the stock and its susceptibility to fishing are determined.  Unfortunately, there are no data for `r spp` that provide insights into these effects.

## Reference Points
Estimates of the current state of the population, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) a spawning potential ratio of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es. Equilibrium yield curve for the base case model is shown in @fig-es-yield.

Unfished spawning stock output for `r spp` is estimated to be 5,647,660 million eggs (95% confidence interval: ,<1–12,581,189 million eggs). The management biomass target for `r spp` is defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output (𝐵40%), which is estimated by the model to be 2,259,070 million eggs (95% confidence interval: <1–5,032,478 million eggs), which corresponds, in a theoretical equilibrium state, to an exploitation rate (catch / age 26+ biomass) of 0.048 (@tbl-ref-points-es, @fig-es-yield). This harvest rate provides an equilibrium yield of 553 mt at 𝐵40% (95% confidence interval: 0–1,224 mt). Catch limits are determined by an SPR = 50% reference point which is associated with equilibrium exploitation rate of 0.040. The model estimate of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is 592 mt (95% confidence interval: 0–1,311  mt). The estimated spawning stock output at MSY is 1,497,160 million eggs (95% confidence interval: 0–3,337,633 million eggs). The exploitation rate corresponding to the estimated FMSY proxy of SPR = 34% is 0.085.

## Management Performance
In the last ten years total dead catches of `r Spp` have been below the annual catch limit. The last ten years total dead catches for `r Spp` against the overfishing limits (OFLs), the acceptable biological catches (ABCs), the annual catch limits (ACLs) are shown in @tbl-es-management.

## Unresolved problems and major uncertainties
`r spp` are one of the longest lived species of rockfish on the West Coast, with maximum ages of 169 years in this assessment. Individual as old as 205 years are reported in literature. It is, therefore, likely that natural mortality for `r spp` is lower than for other rockfish species. With length and age data available only for years after 1994, there is limited ability to monitor the long-term changes of aging cohorts.  Therefore, estimates of natural mortality are uncertain.  This assessment attempts to capture uncertainty in this parameter and integrate it into the derived biomass estimates by estimating natural mortality for females, while fixing the male natural mortality at the value from meta-analytical study. 

Model is also sensitive to assumptions about shape of the selectivity curves, especially for the bottom trawl and non-trawl fleet. In the previous assessment all fleets (except for Triennial Survey) were assumed asymptotic. In this assessment, we provide flexibility for the bottom trawl fleet and bottom trawl surveys to estimate dome-shaped selectivity curves. Changes in selectivity assumptions allow to substantially improve fits to length and age composition data in fisheries and surveys, but also resulted in a substantial increase of stock scale.

## Scientific Uncertainty
The model estimated uncertainty ($\sigma$) around the 2025 spawning output for is 0.6836465. The uncertainty around the OFL is 0.6713586. These values underestimate the overall uncertainty as they do not incorporate the model structural uncertainty and do not account for any time-varying dynamics other than recruitment. The estimated uncertainty values are higher than the Category 1 default of 0.5, so all projections will use the estimated ($\sigma$).

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
Projections of the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a $P^*$ of 0.45 and a log-space standard deviation of the overfishing limit ($\sigma$) of 0.68 (as estimated in this model) are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the acceptable biological catch.

No decision table needed in draft assessments undergoing review.

## Research and Data Needs
There are many areas of research that would benefit the understanding and assessment of `r Spp`.  Below, we identify several of them that we consider particularly important.

*  Understanding the stock structure and biology of Rougheye and Blackspotted Rockfishes:  This assessment reports the status of `r Spp` as a pooled complex because it is extremely difficult to separate the catches of each species even in recent data, and attempting to do so would greatly increase the uncertainty in the predictions.  Because little is known about the respective biology and catch histories of the two species, it is unclear whether managing them as a complex may place one species at disproportionate risk of overfishing relative to the other.  Additional research that will provide insight into the distribution, life history, biological characteristics, and catch and discard profiles of the two species is recommended.  Such an endeavor would like require the efforts of at sea observers in all fleets, biologists aboard fishery-independent surveys, and port samplers along the entire West Coast requiring broad, inter-agency collaboration.

*  Understanding of coatwide stock structure, connectivity, and distribution:  This is a stock assessment for `r Spp` off of the west coast of the U.S. and does not consider data from British Columbia or Alaska.  Further investigating and comparing the data and predictions from British Columbia and Alaska to determine if there are similarities with the U.S. West Coast observations would help to define the connectivity between rougheye rockfish north of the U.S.-Canada border.

*	Natural mortality: Uncertainty in natural mortality translates into uncertain estimates of status and sustainable fishing levels for `r Spp`. Assessment model was able to estimate female natural mortality, consistent with maximum age based meta-analytical prior, but  male natural mortality was fixed in the model. The collection of additional age data and further research of the life-history of `r Spp` may improve our understanding of `r Spp` natural mortality.

* Historical landings and discards, including investigation of fisheries selectivity:  The substantial progress has been made in reconstructing historical landings of rockfishes on the U.S. West Coast, including those for `r Spp`. This assessment highlighted the importance of understanding of fishery selectivity assumptions associated with removals and how fishery selectivity changes throughout the years. Further understanding of this area would help reduce uncertainty in estimated scale of the stock.
