# Data

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current
assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure ) and
sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. Data
that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored
during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or
had not changed since their past exploration for previous `r spp` stock assessments
when they were not used.

<!--- Provide temporal and spatial resolutions or sample size where appropriate for each of the subsections, below.--->

## Fishery-dependent data

<!-- Commercial fisheries landings by state, year, and gear (PacFIN is the standard source for recent domestic commercial landings), historical catch estimates, discards, recreational fisheries catches, foreign removals; sample size information for length- and age-composition data by state, year and gear, including both the number of trips and fish sampled. Description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information by survey and year. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction. -->

### Biological data

#### Length and Age Sample Sizes

##### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishing fleet in the model.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


#### Trawl


#### Non-trawl


#### At-sea-hake fishery






## Fishery-independent data

<!-- Fishery-independent data: Description of surveys used in the assessment, description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information for length- and age- composition data by survey and year, including both the number of tows (or drops or sites for hook and line data) and fish sampled. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction.   -->

## Biological Parameters


### Natural Mortality

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $M$ is natural mortality and ${A_{\text{max}}}$ is the assumed maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31.



### Age and Growth Relationship

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ =  cm; $k$ =  per year; $t_0$ = 

Males $L_{\infty}$ =  cm; $k$ =  per year; $t_0$ = 

\end{centering}

### Ageing Bias and Precision



### Length-Weight Relationship



### Maturity


### Fecundity



### Stock-Recruitment Function and Compensation

### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 

## Environmental and ecosystem data

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors or environmental factors into the assessment model. More predation, diet and habitat work, and mechanistic linkages to environmental conditions would be needed to incorporate these elements into the stock assessment and should remain a priority. McClure et al. [-@mcclure_vulnerability_2023] report the climate vulnerability for several west coast groundfishes, including `r spp`. `r Spp` demonstrated both high biological sensitivity and high climate exposure risk, to give it an overall high vulnerability score to climate change. This result should also be considered with the fact that, like many rockfishes, periods of low productivity is not unusual to `r spp` and their extended longevity (though admittedly this seems shorter than previously believed and should be reconsidered) has historically allowed them to wait for advantageous productivity periods. Stressors such as habitat degradation and climate change could bring significant challenges to population sustainability. Regardless, no environmental or ecosystem data are directly incorporated into the stock assessment model.
