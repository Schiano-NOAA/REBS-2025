# Summary of the 2013 Assessment 

The last assessment of the Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes in U.S. west coast waters was conducted in 2013 and estimated stock status for the beginning of that year at 47% of the unfished stock size, and never showed a decline below the target biomass of 40% of the unfished stock size (Figures 1 and 2). This assessment was informed by both length and age compositions, mean weights, and several indices of abundance. Despite the number of different data types, the large amount of ageing error and mostly flat and largely uncertain indices of abundance result in wide uncertainty intervals around the derived outputs like stock size and status . The complete assessment document can be found [here](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2014/01/the-status-of-rougheye-rockfish-sebastes-aleutianus-and-blackspotted-rockfish-s-melanostictus-as-a-complex-along-the-u-s-west-coast-in-2013-published-january-6-2014.pdf/).


# Bridging the assessment model from Stock Synthesis 3.24 to 3.30 

More than 10 years have passed from the last assessment model and the Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) modelling framework has undergone many changes. While the specific changes in the model can be found in the model [change log](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-ost/projects/11), here we simply update the model from the older 3.24O version to the newer 3.30.22.1 version. We want to ensure that any update to the newest SS3 model is not a cause of any changes in model outputs when we hold all data and model specifications to be exactly the same as in 2013. We therefore transfered all the older data and model specifications to the newest version of SS3 and compared the outputs. The status (Figure 1) and scale (Figure 2) of both models are exactly the same, as are the estimates of within model uncertainty. This allows us to conclude that we can move forward using the latest version of SS3 without having to worry about inheriting any model difference due solely to the choice of SS3 version.

## Unresolved Questions and Issues from the 2015 Assessments

  1. Historical landings and discards. 
  2. Natural mortality. 
  3. Maturity and fecundity. 
  4. Age data and error.
  5. Understanding the stock structure and biology of rougheye and blackspotted rockfishes.
