# Removal Data


## Commercial Landings & Discards

Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish 


Commercial landings are the main source of removals for Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfishes. They are a mainly slope species, typically found around 365m (~200 fathoms), can be shallower down to 275m. Trawl and non-trawl (mostly long-line) are the two major gears they are taken in, with the at-sea-hake midwater fishery also encountering them. Landings are lower in California (Figure Ct_CA) and increase northward, with the biggest trawl catches in Oregon (Figure Ct_WA), and biggest non-trawl catches in Washington (Figure Ct_WA). 

There are some updates in landings by state and fishery, but are overall small and not expected to make a large difference in the stock assessment (Figure Ct_All). Landings over the couple of decades are generally lower than the previous two decades, though more discards are accounted for in the more recent years (Figure Ct_fleets).

### Additional Items for Discussion

* See the discussion on allocating 3A trawl 
* Bottom trawl catch history and the translation of state area codes to PacFIN Catch Area Code 3A (45 46' N. lat TO 47 20' N. lat.; Cape Falcon to Cape Elizabeth) and how catch should be divided between the two assessment areas.
* PacFIN species composition of Washington landings, 1981-1999, for trawl and non-trawl (primarily jig) gears.
* Evaluation of historical species composition data (i.e. pre-1981).
