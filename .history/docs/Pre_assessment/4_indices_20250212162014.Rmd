# Indices of Abundance

Given Rougheye/Blackspotted are associated with deep, structured habitats, it can be difficult to survey them. Four general fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys were used in the 2013 assessment, and are again included in this assessment:

* Triennial (every three years) survey (1980-2004)
* Alaska Fishery Science Center Slope survey (1997-2001)
* Northwest Fisheries Science Center Slope Center (1999-2001)
* West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS; 2003-2204)

Only the WCGBTS has new data for this assessment, but new methods (Spatial and spatiotemporal GLMMs with TMB or [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/)) to develop an index of abundance were applied to all surveys to update all indices. Two distributions (gamma and lognormal) were considered, as was the case in 2013 model when a non-spatial generalized linear mixed model was used to develop indices of abundance.





## Additional Items for Discussion

* Fishery-Independent Indices Items: The historical tag-release data series is long, however there is a large gap in the data from 1990 through 1997. Additionally, data prior to 1990 may not be as reliable as data in the latter part of the data series. Assessment authors are considering truncating the data to begin the index in 1998.
* Assessment authors have discussed combining data from the historical tag-release data series and the nearshore coastal rod-and-reel survey to extend the historical time series through 2022.  If this were done, the Washington coastwide nearshore rod-and-reel index would not be used for this assessment. Nearshore survey data would be limited to spring surveys in MA2 to standardize the data, but concerns have been raised about the prescriptive nature of the survey vs. the inconsistent fishing methods during historic surveys. 
* Fishery-Dependent Indices Items: Bag limits have changed for Black Rockfish over time. These changes may impact the index and recreational selectivity information.
