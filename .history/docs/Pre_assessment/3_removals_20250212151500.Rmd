### Additional Items for Discussion

* See the discussion on allocating 3A trawl 
* Bottom trawl catch history and the translation of state area codes to PacFIN Catch Area Code 3A (45 46' N. lat TO 47 20' N. lat.; Cape Falcon to Cape Elizabeth) and how catch should be divided between the two assessment areas.
* PacFIN species composition of Washington landings, 1981-1999, for trawl and non-trawl (primarily jig) gears.
* Evaluation of historical species composition data (i.e. pre-1981).
