## Maturity and Fecundity

Maturity: 

Fecundity: The previous stock assessment assumed that fecundity was proportional to weight. Dick et al. (2017) provided a study on rockfishes showing that they routinely show a non-proportional relationship of fecundity to weight, with larger individuals producing more eggs than expected only by weight. Neither Rougheye or Blackspotted have a species- of subfamily-specific estimate for this relationship, so this stock assessment uses the unobserved Genus *Sebastes* values of a = 6.538e-06 and b = 4.043 using the F=aL^b relationship.

## Length-Weight

Female and male length-weight relationships were determined using data from the PacFIN database, west coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and ASHOP samples. Samples size by sex were: female (N=13839), males (13625), and unknown sex (53). Each of the data sources estimated very similar length-weight relationships (Figure LW1).

The resultant sex-specific length-weight relationships are given in Figure LW2, with the following individual values: 

* Females: W = 0.000008L^3.15
* Males: W = 0.000012L^3.07

These values are very similar to the previous assessment that used a combine sex value of a=0.0000096 and b=3.12000 (Figure LW2).

## Age and Growth

More ages are expected to be completed in the next month and will be added to the current available set of lengths and ages presented here (Figure AL_1). These data will be used to estimate growth outside and inside (as conditional age at length data) the model with the hope we can use internally estimated growth estimates.

The current available samples f age and lengths by sex are shown below. The female to male sex ratio after age 25 is apparent.

## Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a highly influential parameters in age-structured stock assessments. It defines the rate of natural death by age, and thus establishes a stable age-structure and expectation of longevity, and interacts with the growth and reproduction to determine stock productivity. It is a very difficult parameter to directly measure, thus empirical relationships based on life history parameters are often used to indirectly determine its value or build prior distributions in belief of what it is in the event we do attempt to estimate in the model (Cope and Hamel 2022; Maunder et al. 2023). If length and age data are available, it may be possible to estimate it in the model.

An estimate of maximum age tends to be the most relatable life history parameter to natural mortality. Cope and Hamel (2022) provide the most up-to-date examination of the relationship between maximum age and natural mortality, with a M = 5.4/tmax (using the [Natural Mortality Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/natural-mortality-tool/)), and this is the typical used equation to estimate a natural mortality point estimate. The trick is to come up with a tmax value. This equation assumes that the proportion of the stable population at this maximum age is 0.4517%. If we take humans as an example, the longest lived human is 122 years. This is not the maximum age, but the oldest ever recorded age. The maximum age that corresponds to 0.4517% of the population is around 100 years. For Rougheye/Blackspotted, the oldest ever aged individual is 205 years with unknown ageing error. We did not consider this as a realistic maximum age.

The 2013 West Coast stock assessment used a prior built around a mean of 0.034 (corresponding to a maximum age of 163), but estimated natural mortality at 0.042 (maximum age between 128-129 years; Figure M). The 2023 Gulf of Alaska assessment built a prior conditional on a estimate of natural mortality from their 5 oldest aged individuals that ranged from 126-135 years. This resulted in a mean value of 0.042, similar to the 2013 West Coast stock assessment. The 2023 Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands assessment usesM = 0.05 (assumed longevity of 108), and the recent Canadian assessments considered a range of M values from 0.03 to 0.055 (assumed maximum ages of 180 to 98 years; Figure M). 

We attempt to estimate natural mortality, as was done in the previous West Coast assessment. Examining the available age data, the oldest 10 individuals ranged from 139 to 165. If those oldest ages were used in the Hame and Cope (2022) longevity estimator, this would be a range of natural mortality values of 0.039 to 0.033, which include the mean of the prior used in the 2013 assessment. Applying a catch curve analysis (taking the log of the abundance of numbers of samples in available age classes) on the aggregated ages across all age sources, the total mortality (Natural + Fishing mortality= Total mortality) is 0.042, again indicating the natural mortality may be lower than used in the 2013 assessment, but within values considered in other areas (Figure CC_M).
