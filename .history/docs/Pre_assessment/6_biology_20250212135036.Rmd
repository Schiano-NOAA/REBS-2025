## Maturity and Fecundity

Maturity: 

Fecundity: The previous stock assessment assumed that fecundity was proportional to weight. Dick et al. (2017) provided a study on rockfishes showing that they routinely show a non-proportional relationship of fecundity to weight, with larger individuals producing more eggs than expected only by weight. Neither Rougheye or Blackspotted have a species- of subfamily-specific estimate for this relationship, so this stock assessment uses the unobserved Genus *Sebastes* values of a = 6.538e-06 and b = 4.043 using the F=aL^b relationship.

## Length-Weight

Female and male length-weight relationships were determined using data from the PacFIN database, west coast groundfish bottom trawl survey, and ASHOP samples. Samples size by sex were: female (N=13839), males (13625), and unknown sex (53). Each of the data sources estimated very similar length-weight relationships (Figure LW1).

The resultant sex-specific length-weight relationships are given in Figure LW2, with the following individual values: 

* Females: W = 0.000008L^3.15
* Males: W = 0.000012L^3.07

These values are very similar to the previous assessment that used a combine sex value of a=0.0000096 and b=3.12000 (Figure LW2).

## Age and Growth

Age and length data help provide the data to estimate important growth parameters. Figure AL_1 has the currently available age and length data, with more ages expected to be completed in the next month. Female and male sample sizes are very similar. Estimated growth curves are also presented in Figure AL_1 and the parameter are provided in Table AL_1. The West Coast Groundfish bottom trawl survey clearly and importantly samples the smallest, youngest individuals compared to the other two data sources. This allows for a better estimate of the age at size 0 (t0) and growth coefficient (k). The female asymptotic size (Linf) is estimated notably higher from the PacFIN data, though male estimates of Linf are similar across the data sets.

The coefficient of variation (CV) of length by age and sex are shown in Figure AL_2. This is a measure of the variation in length for a given age class. Sample sizes are highest from the youngest ages up to around 70 (females) to 80 (males) years. The smoothed line shows the average response, and indicates similar CVs values for females and males, with the highest at the youngest ages, but generally 0.1.The amount and range of age samples, along with repeated length samples within an age class, offers hope that the growth parameters (Linf, k, t0, and CVs at age) can be estimated in the model. This will require using the ages as conditioned on lengths.

## Natural Mortality

Natural mortality is a highly influential parameters in age-structured stock assessments. It defines the rate of natural death by age, and thus establishes a stable age-structure and expectation of longevity, and interacts with the growth and reproduction to determine stock productivity. It is a very difficult parameter to directly measure, thus empirical relationships based on life history parameters are often used to indirectly determine its value or build prior distributions in belief of what it is in the event we do attempt to estimate in the model (Cope and Hamel 2022; Maunder et al. 2023). If length and age data are available, it may be possible to estimate it in the model.

An estimate of maximum age tends to be the most relatable life history parameter to natural mortality. Cope and Hamel (2022) provide the most up-to-date examination of the relationship between maximum age and natural mortality, with a M = 5.4/tmax (using the [Natural Mortality Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/natural-mortality-tool/)), and this is the typical used equation to estimate a natural mortality point estimate. The trick is to come up with a tmax value. This equation assumes that the proportion of the stable population at this maximum age is 0.4517%. If we take humans as an example, the longest lived human is 122 years. This is not the maximum age, but the oldest ever recorded age. The maximum age that corresponds to 0.4517% of the population is around 100 years. For Rougheye/Blackspotted, the oldest ever aged individual is 205 years with unknown ageing error. We did not consider this as a realistic maximum age.

The 2013 West Coast stock assessment used a prior built around a mean of 0.034 (corresponding to a maximum age of 163), but estimated natural mortality at 0.042 (maximum age between 128-129 years; Figure M). The 2023 Gulf of Alaska assessment built a prior conditional on a estimate of natural mortality from their 5 oldest aged individuals that ranged from 126-135 years. This resulted in a mean value of 0.042, similar to the 2013 West Coast stock assessment. The 2023 Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands assessment usesM = 0.05 (assumed longevity of 108), and the recent Canadian assessments considered a range of M values from 0.03 to 0.055 (assumed maximum ages of 180 to 98 years; Figure M). 

We attempt to estimate natural mortality, as was done in the previous West Coast assessment. Examining the available age data, the oldest 10 individuals ranged from 165 to 139, and were all males. For females, the 10 oldest individuals range from 130 to 121 years. If those oldest ages were used in the Hame and Cope (2022) longevity estimator, this years would correspond to a range of natural mortality values of 0.033 to 0.039 for males, which include the mean of the prior used in the 2013 assessment. For females, it corresponds to natural mortality values of 0.039 to 0.045. All these assume that the sampled population has enough of an age structure still available for sampling, as opposed to having some level of age truncation from the theoretical unfished stable age distribution.  

Speaking to this issue of possible age truncation, applying a catch curve analysis (taking the log of the abundance of numbers of samples in available age classes) on the aggregated ages across all age sources by sex, the total mortality (Natural + Fishing mortality= Total mortality) is 0.046 for females and 0.035 for males, which may indicate the natural mortality could be lower than used in the 2013 assessment, but within values considered in other areas (Figure CC_M). This also indicates the possibility of estimating sex-specific natural mortality, as they may be different. The two sex model allows for this type of model specification exploration.
