# Composition Data

## Commercial length compositions

Commercial data is is available for all fleets, which will allow for the estimation of selectivity (**Figures Lt_trawl, Lt_Lt_trawl_discard, Lt_nontrawl, Lt_nontrawl_discard, and Lt_ashop**). Data go back into the 1990s for the trawl and non-trawl landed fisheries, and starts in the 2000s for the at-sea-hake fishery. Dead discard fishery data begin in the 2010s. Aggregated length compositions (**Figure Lt_agg**) offers a look at how the composition compare in sampling the population. The trawl fishery gets smaller unsexed fish relative to the non-trawl and at-sea-hake fishery. The trawl dead discards, all unsexed, also show much smaller fish. The dead discards from the non-trawl fishery look to include slightly larger fish than the landings.

The 2013 assessment considered blocking of selectivity as well as dome-shaped selectivity for all fleets and surveys. Given the difficult to access and sample habitats of Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes with the two major gears, natural refugia (based on depth and rugged habitat preference) may explain why older, larger individuals are less accessible, thus a dome-shaped selectivity. That said, large and old individuals are encountered in both fisheries and surveys, some there is some selection occurring for the sizes and ages.

## Survey length compositions

Three of the four surveys have length composition data that allow for estimation of selectivity (**Figures Lt_tri, Lt_AKslope, Lt_WCGBTS**). The NWFSC slope survey shares (or mirrors) the estimated selectivity from the AFSC slope survey. Looking at the aggregate compositions (**Figure Lt_agg**), the WCGBTS clearly gets the largest range in lengths, including the smaller individuals. The Triennial and WCGBTS and the trawl discard, all show an interesting double mode, with a common valley in lengths around 35-40 cm.

## Additional Items for Discussion

* Why do we see the multi-modal distribution in the two surveys and one discard fleet, especially given it is at a similar size?
