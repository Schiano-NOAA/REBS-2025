# Indices of Abundance

Given Rougheye/Blackspotted are associated with deep, structured habitats, it can be difficult to survey them. Four general fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys were used in the 2013 assessment, and are again included in this assessment:

* Triennial (every three years) survey (1980-2004)
* Alaska Fishery Science Center Slope survey (1997-2001)
* Northwest Fisheries Science Center Slope Center (1999-2001)
* West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS; 2003-2204)

Only the WCGBTS has new data for this assessment, but new methods (Spatial and spatiotemporal GLMMs with TMB or [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/)) to develop an index of abundance were applied to all surveys to update all indices. Two distributions (gamma and lognormal) were considered, as was the case in 2013 model when a non-spatial generalized linear mixed model was used to develop indices of abundance.
