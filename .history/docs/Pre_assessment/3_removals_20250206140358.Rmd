## Commercial Landings & Discards

Black rockfish are not considered a major commercial species in Washington, but historical reconstructions have shown prominent trawl and notable jig catches in the past that have subsequently waned over the last 40 years. Historical catch reconstructions were done for the 2015 assessment (see that assessment for the details), and are heavily based on fish ticket reporting and applying highly variable catch compositions to years that do not have measured compositions, but rather just report total or "unknown" rockfish catches, though there was some direct reporting of a black rockfish category that was a mix of other rockfishes. In addition, there is a major interaction in the estimates of trawl-caught black rockfish between Oregon and Washington in reporting area 3A due to the fact that fishers from Astoria fished off Washington and landed those fish in Oregon. This has resulted in some of the largest black rockfish catches ever seen. We are re-evaluating these assumptions along with the Oregon catch reconstruction.

### Additional Items for Discussion

* See the discussion on allocating 3A trawl 
* Bottom trawl catch history and the translation of state area codes to PacFIN Catch Area Code 3A (45 46' N. lat TO 47 20' N. lat.; Cape Falcon to Cape Elizabeth) and how catch should be divided between the two assessment areas.
* PacFIN species composition of Washington landings, 1981-1999, for trawl and non-trawl (primarily jig) gears.
* Evaluation of historical species composition data (i.e. pre-1981).
