# Composition Data

Sample sizes are consistent with the history of the fisheries, with commercial catches higher pre-2000s and the sport fishery better sampled post-2000s.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
add_figure(
  filein = file.path(dir, "plots", "samples.png"), 
  caption = "Female and Male length composition data by year for black rockfish based on fish sampled in the Washington sport fishery.",
  label = 'samples')

```

## Commercial length compositions

Commercial data is is available for all fleets, which will allow for the estimation of selectivity.

## Survey length compositions

Three of the surveys are related to the sport fishery, but two of them (the tag and nearshore surveys) have their own lengths to use to estimate selectivity. The dockside survey is directly sampled from the sport fishery and therefore mirrors the sport fishery selectivity. The nearshore SCUBA survey will either be a recruitment survey or assume a fixed selectivity above a certain length, which is to be determined.
