# Commercial Landings & Discards

Commercial landings are the main source of removals for Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfishes. They are a mainly slope species, typically found around 365 m (~200 fathoms), but can also be common shallower (down to 275 m). This complex is known to school, thus increasing encounters when in an area and available to fishing gear. Trawl and non-trawl (mostly long-line) are the two major fleets they are taken in, with the at-sea-hake midwater fishery also encountering them in notable numbers over the past two decades. Landings are lower in California (**Figure Ct_CA**) and increase northward, with the biggest trawl catches in Oregon (**Figure Ct_OR**), and biggest non-trawl catches in Washington state (**Figure Ct_WA**). There was also a notable catch of Rougheye/Blackspotted accounted for in the trawl fishery that came from the foreign fleet Pacific Ocean Perch fishery in the 1960s. 

There are some updates in landings by state and fishery, but are overall small (**Figure Ct_All**). One notable change is that non-trawl now includes all non-trawl gears, not just hook-and-line as was used in the 2013 assessment. Landings over the last couple of decades are generally lower than in the preceding decades, although we note that more discards are accounted for in recent years (**Figure Ct_fleets**). Updating the 2013 stock assessment with these newest catches leads to a small increase in overall spawning stock output (**FIgure Figure Ct_compsSO**), and essentially no change in the relative stock status (**FIgure Figure Ct_compsRSS**).
