## Executive Summary

### Stock Description
This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes, two species that form one management complex. Despite some identification advances and Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are clearly genetically distinct species, data historically and contemporaneously remain available mostly for the Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish complex, not consistently at the species level.  While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses. This report is for the year 2025 in state and federal waters from California to Washington State, excluding consideration of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea (@fig-map). It seeks to use available catch, biological compositions in the for of lengths and ages, and potential indices of abundance and is the first assessment since the 2013 stock assessment [@hicks_status_2013].


### Catches
`r Spp` are mainly incidentally caught and retained, and caught mainly by trawl (both bottom and midwater) and hook and line gear in commercial fisheries (Figure @fig-es-landings). Commercial catches ramped up in the late 1960s followed by decreasing catches since the mid-1980s. Recreational catches started to increase in the 1980s, fluctuating over time, with high catches over the last several years (@tbl-es-catches).
