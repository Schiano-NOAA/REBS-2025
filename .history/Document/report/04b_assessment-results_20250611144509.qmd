## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability {#model-convergence}

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model_output$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2,000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. No additional parameters were fixed based on this analysis (@fig-pairs_plot_fast).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.01 and 0.05. Both jitter scenarios were repeated 100 times with 78 out of 100 (jitter 0.01) and 49 out of 100 (jitter 0.05) runs returned to the reference model likelihood (@fig-jitter001 and @fig-jitter005). Out of the combined 200 jitter runs, a better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The reference model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions.

### Fits to the Data


#### Lengths

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The aggregate fit to each length composition demonstrates acceptable fits to each fleet and survey source (@fig-agg-len-fit). One noticeable behavior is the trade-off in fit between the fit in the bottom trawl fishery versus the fit in the at-sea-hake (ASHOP) fishery. This current model specification was the best trade off of fits between the two. 

Fits to the annual length composition are provided for the following fisheries and surveys:

<u>Fishery</u>

* Bottom trawl (@fig-len-fit-bt-1 and @fig-len-fit-bt-2)
* Bottom trawl discard (@fig-len-fit-btdis)
* Non-trawl (@fig-len-fit-nt-1 and @fig-len-fit-nt-2)
* Non-trawl discard (@fig-len-fit-ntdis)
* Midwater trawl (@fig-len-fit-midt)
* At-sea-hake (@fig-len-fit-ashop)

<u>Surveys</u>

* Triennial (@fig-len-fit-tri)
* Alaska slope (@fig-len-fit-akslope)
* West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (@fig-len-fit-wcgbts)


Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery (@fig-peasrson-resids-fishery) and survey (@fig-peasrson-resids-survey) length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns. 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting of 1 and blocking patterns, demonstrate fits within the error bars of most years and no strong residual patterns (@fig-meanlt-bt to @fig-meanlt-wcgbts). A notable observation in the means lengths within blocks generally show a lack of trend, not surprising given how many years an individual may be at its maximum size. This is in contrast with the age data that do show more nuances in age structure trend (see next section on age fits for more detail). This demonstrates the general lack of contrast in the length data.


### Ages

#### Conditional Age at Length

Fits to the sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the four fishery and one survey source. Pearson residuals were of reasonable size with no distinct patterns (@fig-peasrson-resids-age-bt1 to @fig-peasrson-resids-age-wcgbts3), as most of the residuals were small and not noteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data compared to the length data (@fig-trawl-mean-caal to @fig-wcgbts-mean-caal). While the mean age for fisheries varied by gear selectivity (25-35 years for bottom trawl; 30-40 years for non-trawl; ~40 for midwater trawl; 40-50 years for the at-sea-hake fishery), one commonality was the increase in mean age in the last year of the model. This consistent increase in mean age across fisheries with different selectivities is important to remember when interpreting the retrospective pattern of the model. Mean age for the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl survey, which catch much smaller and less larger individuals, fluctuated around 20 and did not show an mean age increase in the final year. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations (@fig-call-plot-bt1 to @fig-call-plot-wcgbts6).

#### Marginal Age

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood (@fig-marage_bt to @fig-marage_wcgbts). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model because of the overlap of fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the realized fits are good.  

### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The fits to the 4 available indices of abundance demonstrate little information content in the survey indices (@fig-index-tri to @fig-index-wcgbts). The are all mostly flat with large uncertainty. Such lack of contrast and high uncertainty in the abundance measure indicate the indices contribute little influence to the model (see data sensitvities section below for more details).


## Reference Model Outputs 

 Estimated parameters by category are given in @tbl-n-param. The reference model parameter estimates along with asymptotic standard errors are shown in @tbl-param and the likelihood components are shown in @tbl-likes. Estimates of derived outputs and reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are provided in @tbl-ref-points. 

The estimate of female natural mortality is higher than the assumed value for males, which fits the expectation given the oldest individuals in the population are all males, and within reason (`r round(model_output$parameters[model_output$parameters$Label == "NatM_uniform_Fem_GP_1", 3],3)`) given the oldest individual aged female in the sample. 

Estimated growth parameters values are similar to the externally estimated values (@tbl-param and @fig-vbgf), though with some important difference. The estimated $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ for both sexes were slightly greater and lower than the values estimated externally, respectively. This is not surprising, given external fits assume all variability is in the length at age, while the model incorporates ageing error. Both females and males reach their maximum size at relatively young ages (< half their presumed longevity), thus 

The time series of estimated recruitment deviations and annual recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Years with major recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred  around 1999, 2007, and 2010. These years are very similar to recruitment deviations seen in other rockfishes. One curious signal is the string of positive deviations from 2005-2013, though this is consistently apparent in most model runs. The variance check on the recruitment deviations indicates well informed recruitments from the early 1960s to 2017, providing justification for the estimation of recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:varcheck}). Recruitment deviations after 2017 are relatively uninformed and are not estimated, as is not unexpected from the lag in selectivity with the biological compositions. The recruitment bias adjustment applied within the model across years is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}. The Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship compared to the recruitment deviations are given in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

Estimated selectivity curves for each fleet and survey (Figure \ref{fig:fleet_selectivity}) are all logistic (even though dome-shaped parameters were estimated) and look plausible given the biology (i.e., as a model convergence check for realism, the selectivity curves must look plausible). The commercial fisheies are more right shifted than the other the recreational fishery. The estimate of the peak size of selectivity for the fisheries biggest removal sources (trawl: = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Trawl_wdis(1)", 3],2)` cm; non-trawl = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Non-Trawl_wdis(2)", 3],2)` cm; recreational ocean boat = `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "Size_DblN_peak_Ocean(3)", 3],2)` cm) are above the size of 50% functional maturity (40 cm).
