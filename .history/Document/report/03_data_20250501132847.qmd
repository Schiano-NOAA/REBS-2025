# Data

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current
assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model (@fig-data) and
sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. Data
that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored
during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or
had not changed since their past exploration for previous Rougheye/Blackspotted stock assessments
when they were not used.

<!--- Provide temporal and spatial resolutions or sample size where appropriate for each of the subsections, below.--->

## Fishery-dependent data

<!-- Commercial fisheries landings by state, year, and gear (PacFIN is the standard source for recent domestic commercial landings), historical catch estimates, discards, recreational fisheries catches, foreign removals; sample size information for length- and age-composition data by state, year and gear, including both the number of trips and fish sampled. Description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information by survey and year. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction. -->

Fishery depended data for Rougheye/Blackspotted complex in this assessment are divided among six fleets, which include:
* Fleet 1: Commercial bottom trawl fishery
* Fleet 2: Commercial non-trawl gear (mainly the long-line fishery) fishery
* Fleet 3: Dead discard bottom trawl fleet
* Fleet 4: Dead discard non-trawl fleet
* Fleet 5: Contemporary mid-water fishery
* Fleet 6: Bycatch within the at-sea hake fishery 

There are no recreational landings of this complex on the West coast. 

### Landings

#### Recent landings
Recent commercial landings of rougheye rockfish (2000-2024 for Washington, 1987–2022 for Oregon and 1981–2022 for California,) were obtained from PacFIN, a regional fisheries database that manages fishery-dependent information in cooperation with West Coast state agencies and National Marine Fisheries 
Service (NMFS). Catch data were extracted from PacFIN on April 21, 2015, by state and then combined into the fishing fleets used in the assessment. Time series of recent landings by fleet and state are reported in Table  X and shown in Figures X to X.

#### Historical Landings
Historical landings of Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish were reconstructed by state, by year. 

The Washington historical landings (1889–2000) were provided by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), who recently conducted historical catch reconstruction for rockfish special including rougheye rockfish (pers. comm. T. Tsou, WDFW). The three main sources used in this reconstruction (SpeciesSumOutput2_2017.csv- ADD TABLE) are from the US Fish Commission Report (UFSC), Washington Bound Volumes, and Washington Statistical Bulletin. The historical species composition is based on the various historical reports and interviews of old-time fishermen and dockside samplers. The 1981 to 2000 landings are different from PacFIN records due to a revised approach for apportioning out more unidentified rockfish (“URCK”) in fish tickets to the species level. This revised approach relaxed the borrowing rules for missing data currently used in the WDFW species allocation algorithm (Tsou at al., 2015 - CAN'T FIND IN BIB). New Washington historical landings represent improvement to the assessment. 

The Oregon historical landings (1896–1986) were obtained from Oregon historical catch reconstruction, conducted by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in collaboration with NWFSC (@karnowski_historical_2014). 
The Oregon PacFIN landings for the period between 1987 and 1999 were supplemented with the additional estimates of Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish landings reported within unspecified rockfish market categories, provided by the ODFW (i.e., URCK and POP1; @ODFW_URCK_POP_recon). 

The California historical landings were informed by several sources. Landings from the most recent “historical” period (between 1969 and 1980) were available from the CalCOM database for the California Cooperative Survey (CalCOM) database. Earlier landing records (between 1931 and 1968) were reconstructed by the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (@ralston_documentation_2010). 

Comparison of Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish historical landings by state and fleet between this and 2013 assessment is provided in @fig-Ct_All. 

The largest differences in this assessment from 2013 model are in Washington landings (@fig-Ct_WA), with newly estimated landings being generally lower than those used in previous assessment.  The new WDFW catch reconstruction completed by WDFW is considered an improvement.  

Historical California and Oregon landings did not change substantially (@fig-Ct_CA and @fig-Ct_OR), with the exception of the magnitude of hte catch in a few years. Discrepancies in California and Oregon non-trawl landings between the 2013 and 2025 assessments are caused by the fact that non-trawl fleet in 2013 assessment was limited to only fixed gear, when in 2025 assessment non-trawl includes all non-trawl gear groups.  Slight discrepancies in Oregon trawl landings between 1987 and 1999, are from adding  previously non-reported landings of Rougheye/Blackspotted in the unspecified rockfish market categories (see details above). 

Comparing the update historical data with that used in the 2013 stock assessment shows only minor differences (@fig-Ct_compsSO; @fig-Ct_compsRSS).

#### Recent Landings

ADD FLEET STRUCTURE

Recent commercial landings of rougheye rockfish (2001-2024 for Washington, 1987–2024 for Oregon and 1981–2024 for California,) were obtained from PacFIN, a regional fisheries database that manages fishery-dependent information in cooperation with West Coast state agencies and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Catch data were extracted from PacFIN on April 21, 2025, by state and then combined into the fishing fleets used in the assessment. Time series of recent landings by fleet and state are reported in Table  X and shown in Figures X to X. (ADD THESE TABLE/FIGURES)

### Biological data

#### Length and Age Sample Sizes

##### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishing fleet in the model.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

## Fishery-independent data

<!-- Fishery-independent data: Description of surveys used in the assessment, description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information for length- and age- composition data by survey and year, including both the number of tows (or drops or sites for hook and line data) and fish sampled. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction.   -->

### Abundance indices

Given Rougheye/Blackspotted are associated with deep, structured habitats, it can be difficult to survey them with trawl gear. Four general fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys were used in the 2013 assessment, and are again included in this assessment:

* Triennial (every three years) survey (1980-2004)
* Alaska Fishery Science Center Slope survey (1997-2001)
* Northwest Fisheries Science Center Slope Center (1999-2001)
* West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS; 2003-2024)

Only the WCGBTS has new data for this assessment, but new methods (spatial and spatiotemporal GLMMs with TMB or [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/)) to develop an index of abundance were applied to all surveys to update all indices. Two distributions (gamma and lognormal) were considered, as was the case in 2013 model when a non-spatial generalized linear mixed model was used to develop indices of abundance.

Comparing the standardized versions (i.e., Z-scores, which puts all the indices on the same scale for better comparison of trends) of the indices shows very similar trends among each model output, suggesting little difference in choice of model type. The variance in the indices is generally high (0.3-0.5), suggesting the information content in these indices is low. This is not a surprise given the challenge of sampling these species with trawl gear. Overall, catches densities are highest in northern Oregon and Washington. 

#### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey

The data were truncated to depths less than 875 m prior to modelling given that there were zero positive encounters in depths deeper than 875 m. The prediction grid was also truncated to only include available survey locations in depths between 55-875 m to limit extrapolating beyond the data and edge effects. 

The response variable in the model was catch (mt) with an offset of area (km2) to account for differences in effort. Fixed effects were estimated for each year. The following additional covariate was included: pass. 

Spatial variation, but not spatiotemporal variation, was included in the encounter probability and the positive catch rate model. Spatial variation was approximated using 200 knots, where more knots led to non-estimable standard errors.


#### NWFSC Slope Survey


#### AFSC Slope Survey


#### AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey

The triennial survey was first conducted by the AFSC in 1977 and spanned the timeframe from 1977–
2004. The survey’s design and sampling methods are most recently described in **Weinberg et al. (2002)**.
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth
range were initiated **(Figure X)**. The survey design has changed slightly over the period of time **(Table X,
Figure X)**. In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall: the 1977
survey was conducted from early July through late September; the surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran
from mid-July to late September; the 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October; the 1995
survey was conducted from early June to late August; the 1998 survey ran from early June through early
August; and the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July **(Figure X)**.

Haul depths ranged from 91–457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m. The
surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to 36.8°N latitude and a depth range of
55–366 meters. The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern
range to 34.5°N (near Point Conception). From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range
55–500 meters and surveyed south to 34.5°N. In the final year of the triennial series (2004), the
NWFSC’s Fishery Resource and Monitoring division (FRAM) conducted the survey and followed very
similar protocols as the AFSC.

<!-- NEED TO UPDATE THIS: Given the different depths surveyed during 1977, the data from that year were not included in this
assessment. Water hauls **(Zimmermann et al. 2003)** and tows located in Canadian waters were also
excluded from the analysis of this survey. The survey was analyzed as an early series (1980–1992) and a
late series (1995–2004), as has been done in other West Coast rockfish assessments. -->

<!-- NEED TO UPDATE THIS: The indices for the early and late series of this survey were estimated separately using a GLMM with the
stratifications shown in **Table X**. Boxplots of the deviance for the late and early triennial survey series are
shown in **Figure X** and show that the lognormal distribution had the lowest median deviance for both
series. Random or fixed strata-year effects produced similar deviance, and the random strata-year effects
were chosen as the final models. Selection of using the extreme catch event mixture distribution (ECE)
was done by investigating the Q-Q plots in **Figure X**. The Q-Q plot for no ECE does not show any
departures from the assumed distribution, and the ECE Q-Q plot did not show improvement. Therefore,
the lognormal distribution without the ECE mixture distribution and random effects on the year-strata
interaction were used to estimate the indices shown in **Figure X** and **Table X**. The early series suggests a
possible slightly increasing trend in biomass from 1983–1992, while the late series showed no discernible
trend and alternated between high and low estimates from 1995–2004. The design-based estimates
(average density expanded to the stratum area then summed over strata) are compared to the model-based estimates in **Figure X**. 
Similar trends are seen for both sets of estimates, but the design-based estimates
are consistently greater than the model-based estimates by more than a factor of 2. This suggests that the
scale of the model-based estimates may be low, which may be caused by incorrect expansion to the
proper area. This is not an issue with the assessment because a catchability coefficient relating the survey
biomass to the assessment model biomass is estimated without any prior assumption on what value that
catchability coefficient should be. Therefore, caution is advised if attempting to interpret the value of that
estimated catchability coefficient. -->

<!-- NEED TO UPDATE THIS: Length frequencies for each year were expanded using the same stratification as the GLMM, except that
no observations were available for 1983 **(Figure X)**. Because sex ratios showed no discernible trend
across years and surveys, and rougheye rockfish show no tendency toward sexual dimorphism (see
sections below), we pooled male, female, and unsexed length data in this analysis. There was
considerable variability in length frequencies in the triennial survey data. Mean length in the triennial
survey declined during the period 1986–1992 from 31.0 cm to 21.9 cm, and there was no clear trend in
mean length from 1995–2004. Mean length in the late period (1995–2004) was larger than mean length
in the early period (1980–1992), except in 2004. This further supports the split into early and late
periods. -->


### Biological data
#### NWFSC West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey


#### NWFSC Slope Survey


#### AFSC Slope Survey


#### AFSC/NWFSC West Coast Triennial Shelf Survey



## Biological Parameters
The major biological inputs to the models are natural mortality, age and growth parameters, weight-length, maturity and stock-recruitment parameters. The following sections outline the treatment of each section. One change from the previous assessment is moving to a two sex from the one-sex specification from 2013. The 2013 stock assessment one-sex specification was based on the observation that the biology of females and males was very similar, thus justifying the simplifying assumption of one sex. The following sections below demonstrates that females and males do generally have similar growth, though there are differences, but may have different natural mortality values. The current assessment will use a two sex configuration that allows for flexibility to set female and male parameters either equal (i.e., functionally equivalent to a one sex model) and or sex-specific. @fig-Sex1vs2_SO and @fig-Sex1vs2_Bratio show that using a two sex configuration with the same life history parameters for females and males is equivalent to the one sex model. Note that the one sex model sums up both female and male biomass, thus why it is twice the size as the two sex female-only spawning output (@fig-Sex1vs2_Bratio).

### Natural Mortality
Natural mortality is a highly influential parameter in age-structured stock assessments. It defines the rate of natural death by age, and thus establishes a stable age-structure and expectation of longevity, and interacts with growth and reproduction to determine stock productivity. It is a very difficult parameter to directly measure, thus empirical relationships based on life history parameters are often used to indirectly determine its value or build prior distributions in belief of what it is in the event we do attempt to estimate it in the model (@cope_upgrading_2022; @hamel_development_2022; @maunder_review_2023). If length and age data are available, it may be possible to estimate it in the model.

An estimate of maximum age tends to be the most reliable life history parameter related to natural mortality to inform its estimation. @cope_upgrading_2022 ([The Natural Mortality Tool](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/natural-mortality-tool/)) provide the most up-to-date examination of the relationship between maximum age and natural mortality

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $M$ is natural mortality and ${A_{\text{max}}}$ is the assumed maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31. This is the equation typically used to estimate a natural mortality point estimate, but is underpinned by the choice of the value of ${A_{\text{max}}}$. This equation assumes that the proportion of the stable population at this maximum age is 0.4517%. If we take humans as an example, the longest lived human is 122 years. This is not the maximum age, but the oldest ever recorded age. The maximum age that corresponds to 0.4517% of the population is around 100 years. For Rougheye/Blackspotted, the oldest ever aged individual is 205 years with unknown ageing error. We did not consider this as a realistic maximum age.

The 2013 U.S. west coast stock assessment used a prior built around a mean of 0.034 (corresponding to a maximum age of 163), but estimated natural mortality at 0.042 (maximum age between 128-129 years; Figure M). The 2023 Gulf of Alaska assessment built a prior conditional on a estimate of natural mortality from their 5 oldest aged individuals that ranged from 126-135 years. This resulted in a mean value of 0.042, similar to the 2013 U.S. west coast stock assessment. The 2023 Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands assessment used M = 0.05 (assumed longevity of 108), and the recent Canadian assessments considered a range of M values from 0.03 to 0.055 (assumed maximum ages of 180 to 98 years; @fig-Mcurves). 

We attempt to estimate natural mortality, as was done in the 2013 U.S. West coast assessment. Examining the available age data, the oldest 10 individuals range from 139 to 165 and were all males. For females, the 10 oldest individuals range from 130 to 121 years. If those oldest ages were used in the @hamel_development_2022 longevity estimator, these ages would correspond to a range of natural mortality values of 0.033 to 0.039 for males, which include the mean of the prior used in the 2013 assessment. For females, it corresponds to natural mortality values of 0.039 to 0.045. All these assume that the sampled population has enough of an age structure still available for sampling, as opposed to having some level of age truncation from the theoretical unfished stable age distribution.  

Related to this issue of possible age truncation, applying a catch curve analysis (taking the log of the abundance of numbers of samples in available age classes) on the aggregated ages across all age sources by sex, the total mortality (Natural + Fishing mortality= Total mortality) is 0.046 for females and 0.035 for males, which may indicate the natural mortality could be lower than that used in the 2013 assessment, but within the range of values considered in other areas (@fig-CC_Z). This also indicates the possibility of estimating sex-specific natural mortality, as natural mortality may differ by sex. The two sex model allows for this type of model specification exploration. Further exploration was done my truncating the upper ages considered, with the assumption that the older ages may also not be sampled fully (i.e., dome-shaped selectivity). We considered both 100 (@fig-CC_Z_100) and 80 (@fig-CC_Z_80) as upper age cut-offs. The less older individuals included, the higher the estimate of total mortality, and this a higher natural mortality. But we can see a general overestimate of how many older individuals are expected using these higher Z values, thus dome-shapeness does not see to explain the sampling of these older individuals.

One challenge to estimating natural mortality within the model is the interaction of estimating dome-shaped selectivity with estimating natural mortality. If all fleets assume some level of dome-shaped selectivity, it is difficult to determine if the unseen larger, older individuals are due to natural death or fishing mortality. Typically, at least one major fleet needs to achieve full selectivity for the larger, older individuals. The 2013 assessment suggested some dome-shaped selectivity in the two major fleets, thus any natural mortality estimates are evaluated depending on the forms of fleet selectivity.


### Age and Growth Relationship
Age and length data are used to estimate important growth parameters. @fig-AL_1 has the currently available age and length data. Female and male sample sizes are very similar. Estimated growth curves are also presented in @fig-AL_1 and the parameters are provided in Table AL_1. The West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey clearly and importantly samples the smallest, youngest individuals compared to the other two data sources. This allows for a better estimate of the age at size 0 (t~0~) and growth coefficient (k). The female asymptotic size (L~$\infty$~) is estimated notably higher from the PacFIN data, though male estimates of Linf are similar across the data sets. The overall externally derived estimates of female and male `r Spp` are

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ = 58.81 cm; $k$ = 0.08; $t_0$ = -1.19

Males $L_{\infty}$ = 57.13 cm; $k$ = 0.09; $t_0$ = -1.26

\end{centering}

The coefficient of variation (CV) of length by age and sex are shown in @fig-AL_2. This is a measure of the variation in length for a given age class. Sample sizes are highest from the youngest ages up to around 70 (females) to 80 (males) years. The smoothed line shows the average response, and indicates similar CVs values for females and males, with the highest at the youngest ages, but generally 0.1. The amount and range of age samples, along with repeated length samples within an age class, allows growth parameters (L~$\infty$~, k, t~0~, and CVs at age) to be estimated in the model. Ages are conditioned on lengths in the model in order to estimate growth within the model. We also explore sensitivity in growth values by pre-specifying growth to different values.

We note that the growth values being estimated in our data are notably different than those used in Alaska. For instance, the growth parameters for the BSAI stock is L~$\infty$~ = 51.43, k = 0.06 and t~0~ = -3.30 and L~$\infty$~ = 54.2 cm, k = 0.07, t~0~= -1.5 for the GOA population (both sexes combined). These growth parameters shows a larger size and faster growth of the West Coast stock complex versus those in Alaska, though the West Coast stock complex is more similar to the GOA complex.

### Ageing Bias and Precision
Counting ages from ageing structures in long-lived, temperate fishes is challenging. Ages derived from these structures can be hard to reproduce within and between readers (i.e., imprecision), and may not contain the true age (i.e., bias). Stock assessment outputs can be affected by bias and imprecision in ageing, thus it is important to quantify and integrate this source of variability when fitting age data in assessments. In Stock Synthesis 3, this is done by including ageing error matrices that include the mean age (row 1) and standard deviation in age (row 2). Ageing bias is implemented when the inputted mean age deviates from the expected middle age for any given age bin (e.g., 1.75 inputted versus 1.5 being the true age for the age 1 bin); ageing imprecision is given as the standard deviation for each age bin.

There are eight primary readers that provided the available ages, two of which often split the ageing duties. Table X shows which reader assignments are given to each year of ages. Reader 7 is the mix of two readers that shared reading duties within years.  

Estimation of ageing error matrices used the approach of -@punt_quantifying_2008 in two different forms: one developed in AD Model Builder (\href{https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} [@thorson_nwfscageingerror:_2012]) and one adapted to Template Model Builder framework (\href{https://pfmc-assessments.github.io/AgeingError/articles/getting_started.html}{TMB}). The ageing error matrix offers a way to calculate both bias and imprecision in age reads. Reader 1 is always considered unbiased, but may be imprecise. Bias relative to the primary reader is given for the second reader. There were three age readers that were assumed to be unbiased. In those cases, 12 model configurations based on different assumptions of imprecision (constant CV, curvilinear standard deviation, or curvilinear CV, along with an option to either share or independently estimate imprecision between readers) were considered. For the other four age readers that could be biased and/or imprecise, thirty-six total model configurations were explored that included the above imprecision models as well as an exploration of the functional form of bias (e.g., no bias, constant coefficient of variation, or non-linear bias) in the second reader. 

Model selection criteria included AIC corrected for small sample size (AICc), which converges to AIC when sample sizes are large, and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Both ADMB and TMB were run using an (\href{https://pfmc-assessments.github.io/AgeingError/articles/getting_started.html}{ageing error shiny app}). Model selection was then compared between ADMB and TMB, which did not always agree, so model selection criteria was added across the two modeling approaches to get an overall model selection criteria. Ageing error matrices were also inspected for behavior in the best supported models to make sure outrageously large precision or bias was not chosen (effectively rendering the ages worthless, which is not an assumption of the quality of the ages). @fig-AE_bias and @fig-AE_SD show the bias and imprecision assumptions applied for each ageing error (AE) matrix.


### Length-Weight Relationship
Female and male length-weight relationships were determined using data from the PacFIN database, West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, and ASHOP samples. Samples size by sex were: female (N=13839), males (13625), and unknown sex (53). Each of the data sources estimated very similar length-weight relationships (@fig-LW1).

The resultant sex-specific length-weight relationships are given in @fig-LW2, with the following individual values: 

* Females: W = 0.000008L^3.15
* Males: W = 0.000012L^3.07

These values are very similar to the previous assessment that used a combine sex value of a=0.0000096 and b=3.12000 (@fig-LW2).


### Maturity
An updated maturity analysis for the Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish complex with additional samples to estimate the length at which 50% of females in the population are mature (L50) is completed. Biological maturity identifies females that are physiologically capable of spawning. Functional maturity identifies females that are physiologically capable of spawning and will likely spawn in a given year. The most recent L50 estimate (not yet updated) of biological maturity is 43.84 cm and the most recent L50 estimate (not yet updated) of functional maturity is 48.44 cm.


### Fecundity
The 2013 U.S. west coast stock assessment assumed that fecundity was proportional to weight. Dick et al. (2017) provided a study on rockfishes showing that rockfishes routinely have a non-proportional relationship of fecundity to weight, with larger individuals producing more eggs than expected only by weight. Neither Rougheye or Blackspotted rockfishes have a species- of subfamily-specific estimate for this relationship, so this stock assessment uses the unobserved Genus Sebastes values of a = 6.538e-06 and b = 4.043 using the F=aL^b relationship.

### Stock-Recruitment Function and Compensation
The Beverton-Holt stock recruit relationship is assumed, as it was in the 2013 assessment, to describe the relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment. The steepness parameter may be considered for estimation, but it is notoriously difficult to estimate in assessment models. The 2013 stock assessment used the previous rockfish steepness mean value of 0.77, but this has subsequently been updated to 0.72, to a value that represents a stock with somewhat lower recruitment compensation. Natural variation in recruitment (i.e., not deterministically taken from the stock-recruit curve) is apparent in the length and age data (as notable length or age classes growing/ageing over time), so deviations in recruitment are estimated.

### Sex Ratio
No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 

## Environmental and ecosystem data
This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors or environmental factors into the assessment model. More predation, diet and habitat work, and mechanistic linkages to environmental conditions would be needed to incorporate these elements into the stock assessment and should remain a priority. @McClure:2023:VCC report the climate vulnerability for several west coast groundfishes, including `r spp`. `r Spp` demonstrated both high biological sensitivity and high climate exposure risk, to give it an overall high vulnerability score to climate change. This result should also be considered with the fact that, like many rockfishes, periods of low productivity is not unusual to `r spp` and their extended longevity (though admittedly this seems shorter than previously believed and should be reconsidered) has historically allowed them to wait for advantageous productivity periods. Stressors such as habitat degradation and climate change could bring significant challenges to population sustainability. Regardless, no environmental or ecosystem data are directly incorporated into the stock assessment model.
