## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability {#model-convergence}

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2,000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. No additional parameters were fixed based on this analysis (@fig-pairs_plot_fast).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.0001. This was repeated 100 times with 5 out of 100 runs returned to the reference model likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:jitter}). There were another 11 models within 1 -log likelihood unit from the reference model, and another 18 within 2 -log likleihood units, all returning very similar model results. Out of the 100 jitter runs, a better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made.
