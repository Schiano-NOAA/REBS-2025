## Characterizing uncertainty

### Sensitivity Analyses {#sec-assmt-sens}

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities

Data treatments explored the removal of data types (indices and biological compositions), data weighting options and ageing error treatment. 

##### Removal of data sources 

The following data source sensitivities were explored:

* Remove a single index of abundance (Triennial, Alaska slope, NW slope, WCGBTS, all indices)
* For each fleet and index, including discard fleets, removal of length composition data
* For each fleet and the WCGBTS, removal of age composition data

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data source removal sensitivity are available in @tbl-sensitivities-like-indices to @tbl-sensitivities-like-age. Additionally, time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in @fig-sens_indices_spout to @fig-sens_age_relsp. Derived quantities relative of all data removal sensitivities to the reference model are summarized in @fig-sens_sum_data. Generally, the removal of indices of abundance decreased both the spawning output and the relative spawning output as compared to the base model (@fig-sens_indices_spout and @fig-sens_indices_relsp). Of these, the WCGBTS appears to have the most significant impact. Removal of the bottom trawl (bottom trawl + discards) and non-trawl (non-trawl + discards) fishery length compositions decreased the spawning output and the relative spawning output, whereas removal of the mid-water trawl and the at-sea hake length compositions increased the spawning output and relative spawning output (@fig-sens_lens1_spout and @fig-sens_lens1_relsp). Of the length composition removals, the most influential data sources appear to be the fishery fleets and removal of the survey length compositions had a limited impact on both spawning output and relative spawning output compared to the base model (@fig-sens_lens2_spout and @fig-sens_lens2_relsp). Finally, the removal of any age composition data source decreased the spawning output, with the exception of the mid-water trawl ages, and decreased the relative spawning output (@fig-sens_age_spout and @fig-sens_age_relsp). Again, the WCGBTS appears to be the most influential of the data sources with age composition information.

  	
##### Data weighting

The following data weighting sensitivities were explored:

* No data-weighting
* Dirichlet data-weighting
* McAllister-Ianelli data weighting

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data weighting sensitivity are available in . Comparison plots for the results relative to the reference model are in @fig-sensi-data-wt and @fig-sensi-RE-data-wt. Each data weighting scenario up-weighted the influence of the length data relative to the age data. This resulted in a large drop in the stock scale, but little change in the high stock status. These changes were within the uncertainty of the base model, though at the low end for the stock scale.


##### Ageing error

The following ageing error sensitivities were explored:

  * No Ageing error for all sources (unbiased and precise ages)
  * No ageing error for each source at a time

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each ageing error sensitivity are available in . Comparison plots for the results relative to the reference model are in @fig-sensi-ageing-error and @fig-sensi-RE-ageing-error. A drop in both stock scale and stock status is generally observed when the ageing error is removed. One notable observation is that the recruitment events become less resolved and variance increases in lengths at age when ages are assumed biased and precise. When the ages are taken as true, all variation between lengths and ages are interpreted in the lengths, while the recruitment must interpret the age composition precisely, thus assigning positive recruitment deviations to years adjacent to strong recruitment years seen in the reference model. Having more positive recruitment can compensate for a lower initial stock size, causing the initial stock size to decrease. All in stock scale and status changes were within the uncertainty of the base model.


#### Sensitivities to Model Specification  {#senstivities}

Model specifications looked at the treatment of life history parameters selectivity and the estimation of recruitment. All scenarios match the reference model specifications in all other aspects unless otherwise stated.

* Life history parameters

	* Natural mortality ($M$)

		1. Estimate female $M$
		2. Fix $M$ to 2013 value		
		3. Lorenzen age varying $M$
	
	* Growth parameters

	 	4. Fix all growth parameters to external values

	* Reproductive Biology

		5. Proportional fecundity to weight
		6. Functional maturity at age
		7. Functional maturity at length for Blackspotted Rockfish
		8. Functional maturity at length for Rougheye Rockfish
		9. Biological maturity at length

	
Summaries of the model results for these sensitivities are presented in **Table X**, @fig-sensi-LH and @fig-sensi-RE-LH. Additionally, the scale comparisons minus the estimation of $M$ scenario is provided in @fig-sensi-LH-so as that model scenario showed such higher estimates of scale to obscure all other models. Note also that the proportional fecundity scale measure is in metric tons, not millions of eggs, and thus are not comparable in scale to the other models.

None of the sensitivities were found to be outside of the reference model uncertainty for scale or stock status (@fig-sensi-RE-LH). In particular, the stock status was highly conserved over these sensitivities, while both the initial and final stock scales were more sensitive (but still within the uncertainty of the reference model). In general, higher natural mortality assumptions reduced the stock scale when the bottom trawl and non-trawl fisheries were dome-shaped, as did the fixing of growth to the external model estimates. For reproductive biology, scale decreased if either age at maturity of functional length at maturity for Blackspotted Rockfish only was used. But scale increased if either functional maturity for Rougheye Rockfish only or biological maturity was used. The reference model, a mix of both species maturity at length, settled the scale inbetween each individual species-specific functional maturity model. For this long-lived species and future consideration, age may be a more precise determination of maturity (because there is a wide range of lengths per age) than length; however, age data is more limited and further information is encouraged to build this relationship. 


* Recruitment estimation

 	13. No recruitment estimation
 	14. Estimate from 1940 onward
	15. Estimate from 1980 onward
	
* Selectivity

	16. Logistic selectivity for all fisheries and time blocks
	17. Logistic selectivity for bottom trawl fishery
	18. Logistic selectivity for non-trawl fishery
 
Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table . Comparison plots for the results relative to the reference model are in @fig-sensi-SelRec and @fig-sensi-RE-SelRecfig-sensi-RE-SelRecfig-sensi-RE-SelRec. Few (starting in 1980) or no recruitment deviation estimation leads to larger stock scale required to make up for the catch history and lack of recruitment compensation. There is a drop in stocks status when starting recruitment deviations in 1940, but more similar to the referece model. Stock status is steady in these scenarios and all uncertainty is included in the reference model uncertainty. 


### Likelihood profiles

#### Initial unfished recruitment (lnR0)


#### Steepness ($h$)


#### Male natural mortality ($M$)


### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

There are no major unresolved problems in the stock assessment, but there are many sources of uncertainty. Natural mortality remains a large source of uncertainty. The estimation of growth also required fixing certain parameters, leading to an underestimation of uncertainty in the model. The stock-recruit relationship is assumed to be a Beverton-Holt relationship with a fixed steepness of 0.72. Large uncertainty was shown if the nature of this relationship varies either deterministically or over time. The full time series of recruitment deviations were not informed, which creates some historical and contemporary uncertainty. Likewise, all life history values are assumed constant, so any time-varying issues that are directional could create more uncertainty.
