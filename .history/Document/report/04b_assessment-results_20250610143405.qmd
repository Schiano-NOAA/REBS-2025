## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability {#model-convergence}

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model_output$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2,000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. No additional parameters were fixed based on this analysis (@fig-pairs_plot_fast).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.01 and 0.05. Both jitter scenarios were repeated 100 times with 78 out of 100 (jitter 0.01) and 49 out of 100 (jitter 0.05) runs returned to the reference model likelihood (@fig-jitter001 and @fig-jitter005). Out of the combined 200 jitter runs, a better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The reference model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions.

### Fits to the Data


#### Lengths

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The aggregate fit to each length composition demonstrates acceptable fits to each fleet and survey source (@agg-len-fit). One noticeable behavior is the trade-off in fit between the fit in the bottom trawl fishery versus the fit in the at-sea-hake (ASHOP) fishery. This current model specification was the best trade off of fits between the two. 

Fits to the annual length composition are shown in [Appendix A](#app_a). 

Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery and survey length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns (Figure \ref{fig:lt-pearson-resids}). 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting, do not closely follow the dynamics in means lengths in the relatively small trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:trawl-mean-len-fit}). The mean lengths generally follow the trend seen in the non-trawl fishery (Figure \ref{fig:nontrawl-mean-len-fit}) and recreational (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}) fisheries, but still miss the detailed dynamics. The tagging survey fits are one of the better in the model (Figure \ref{fig:tag-mean-len-fit}). Fits to the mean length in the Nearshore survey, only three points at this point, are not particularly good (Figure \ref{fig:nearshore-mean-len-fit}). The fits to the mean length data from the dive survey does follow the general trend in the data (Figure \ref{fig:ocnms-mean-len-fit}). All length weighting are near the value of 1 as is expected when using the Francis weighting method. One thing to note is the general weak contrast in the data over the past two decades.

Aggregate fits over year by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The aggregates are fairly good, though there does seem to be a slight underfitting of the bigger individuals seen in the fishery-based samples.
