## Assessment

### History of Modeling Approaches

A previous Category 3 stock assessment was conducted for the U.S. Pacific Coast stock of Rougheye Rockfish (not including Blackspotted) in 2010 by Dick and MacCall (2010) using depletion-based stock reduction analysis (DB-SRA).  That model estimated the population had greater than a 50% probability of exceeding the estimated proxy overfishing level in 2010 if the harvest remained at the observed levels.  DB-SRA estimated a proxy OFL for rougheye rockfish of 78.7 mt with a 95% confidence interval between 4.7-587 metric tons.  

A 2013 benchmark stock assessment [@hicks_status_2013] updated the modeling framework to the integrated statistical catch-at-age model Stock Synthesis 3, which is different from the delay-difference model with an assumed stock status prior in 2010 used in the DB-SRA analysis. The 2013 assessment used a substantially updated catch history, indices of abundance, and biological compositions (lengths and ages). The natural mortality value was also updated to be higher than that used in the DB-SRA model. The stock assessment was accepted for management as a Category 2 stock assessment.

### Most Recent STAR Panel Recommendations

There were several recommendations from the 2013 STAR panel, broken into two categories

#### General recommendations

1. Investiage data-weighting options. This has been an ongoing research topic in stock assessments since this panel, and several options are no available for consideration.
2. A workshop for constructing abundance indices from survey GLMMs. This is another topic that has developed greatly since this time. Our use of spatio-temporal models are described in the data section on abundance indices.
3. Continue collection of ages. This had been done, and this assessment benefits from several more years of age data.
4. Exploring historical catches. This again has been an ongoing topic and addressed for many of our groundfishes. We use the latest estimates in this assessment.
5. SSC guidance on decision tables. Decision table discussion evolve after every stock assessment cycle, and we are using the latest approaches to decision tables in this assessment.
6. Investigate fishery-independent slope surveys, such as submersibles. These surveys are not currently available for slope species.

#### Stock-specific recommendations

1. Collecting additional age data. This has been done and included in this stock assessment.
2. Collecting genetic material to explore distinguishing Rougheye and Blackspotted Rockfishes. This work has been done as was presented earlier in the document when discussing stock structure decisions.
3. 
  

### Response to SSC Groundfish Subcommittee Recommendations

## Current Modelling Platform

Stock Synthesis version 3.30.23.1 was used as the statistical catch-at-age modelling framework. This framework allows the integration of a variety of data types and model specifications. The Stock Assessment Continuum tool (https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool) was used also used to explore model efficiency, likelihood profiling, retrospective analyses, and plotting sensitivities. The companion R package r4ss (version 1.51.0) along with R version 4.4.3 were used to investigate and plot model fits.


### Bridging the Assessment Model from Stock Synthesis 3.24 (2013) to 3.30 (2025)

More than 10 years have passed from the last assessment and in that time, the model and the Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3) modelling framework has undergone many changes. While the specific changes in the model can be found in the model [change log](https://github.com/orgs/nmfs-ost/projects/11), here we simply update the model from the older 3.24O version to the newer 3.30.22.1 version. We want to ensure that any update to the newest SS3 model software is not a cause of any changes in model outputs when we hold all data and model specifications to be exactly the same as in 2013. We therefore transferred all the older data and model specifications to the newest version of SS3 and compared the outputs. The status (@fig-RSS_2013) and scale (@fig-SO_2013) of both models are exactly the same, as are the estimates of within model uncertainty. This allows us to conclude that we can move forward using the latest version of SS3 without concern of inheriting any model difference due solely to the choice of the SS3 version. 


## Model Structure, Evaluation, and Specification

### Fleet and Survey Designations

The model is structured to track several fleets and include data from several surveys:

* Fleet 1: Commercial trawl fishery
* Fleet 2: Commercial non-trawl (mostly jig) fishery
* Fleet 3: Recreational boat fishery
* Fleet 4: Recreational boat fishery
* Fleet 5: Recreational boat fishery
* Fleet 6: Recreational boat fishery
* Survey 1: Private boat  
* Survey 2: Charter
* Survey 3: Tagging 
* Survey 4: Nearshore
* Survey 5: OCNMS subadult-adult survey
* Survey 6: OCNMS young-of-the-year survey

The specifications of the assessment are listed in Table \ref{tab:model-structure}.

## Model Likelihood Components

There are five primary likelihood components for each assessment model:

1. Fit to survey indices of abundance.
2. Fit to length composition samples.
3. Fit to age composition samples (all fit as conditional age-at-length).
4. Penalties on recruitment deviations (specified differently for each model).
5. Prior distribution penalties

## Reference Model Exploration, Key Assumptions and Specification

The reference model for Washington `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory and relative stock status for the population of `r spp` in state and federal waters off Washington. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses different data types and sources to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model. Constructing integrated models (i.e., those fitting many data types) takes considerable model exploration using different configurations of the following treatments:

- Data types
- Parameter treatments: which parameter can, cannot and do not need to be estimated
- Phasing of parameter estimation 
- Data weighting
- Exploration of local vs global minima (see Model Convergence and Acceptability section  below)

The different biological data with and without the catch time series (and no additional data weighting) were first included to obtain an understanding of the signal of stock status coming from the data (Figure ). The length and age only models assume a constant catch over the entire time series, while estimating the selectivity of each fleet. Under this constraint, the lengths suggest a stock a bit lower than the reference model, while the ages consider the stock is extremely depleted. Putting the two data sources together produce an intermediate stock status in the lower precautionary zone. Adding the catch time series substantially changes the stock status trajectory, with length or age only model above the reference stocks status. Combining the two came out just under the reference model. Only one model includes recruitment deviations, and demonstrates more dynamics behavior similar to that seen when biological compositions are unweighted (see Model Specification Sensitivities section ). 

Stock scale was comparable once removal history was included, and demonstrates a large sensitivity to the scale of the stock given the data with no additional weighting included (Figure ).

Numerous exploratory models that included all data types and a variety of model specifications were subsequently explored and too numerous to fully report. In summary, the estimation of which life history parameters to estimate and fix was liberally explored.

The following is a list of things that were explored, typically in combination with one another

- Estimate or fix $M$
- Estimate or fix any of the three growth parameter for each sex
- Estimate or fix the stock-recruit relationship
- Estimate or assume constant recruitment. If estimating recruitment, for what years?
- Estimate or fix survey catchability for each survey
- Estimate additional survey variance for which survey
- Estimate or fix selectivity parameters
- Logistic or dome-shaped selectivity?

After much consideration, it was determined that some parameters were inestimable ($M$, $L_{min}$ for both sexes), some did not move much for initial values and could be fixed (e.g., CV at length values, some selectivity parameters), and others could be estimated (e.g., $L_{\infty}$, $k$, $lnR_0$). Estimation of $L_min$ returned very high estimates of $L_{\infty}$ for both sexes, thus the $L_{min}$ value for both females and males was fixed to the external estimates. No priors were used on any of the estimated parameters except female $L_{\infty}$ which used a normal prior and a standard deviation set a bit higher from the external fit to the growth curve (0.2). Length-at-maturity, fecundity-weight, and length-weight relationship, steepness ($h$) and recruitment variance were all fixed. 

The selectivity of all fisheries were estimated as logistic even if dome-shaped selectivity was an option (and starting values begin at a strong dome-shaped position). Constant selectivity was assumed for the whole time period as there was no reason to suggest otherwise, and is consistent with the previous stock assessment treatment.

The full list of estimate and fixed parameters are found in Table }. 

The biggest uncertainty was in the treatment of sex-specific $M$, as estimation came in very low for both sexes versus observed ages in the population and the treatment in the last assessment. This parameter affects both scale and status, and thus is a valuable parameter to consider for characterizing model specification error and defining states of nature. Both likelihood profiles and sensitivities explore the influence of this parameter on derived model outputs.

General attributes of the reference model are that indices of abundance are assumed to have lognormal measurement errors. Length compositions and conditional age at length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size calculated during compositional example, and where this input sample size is subsequently reweighted to account for additional sources of overdispersion (see below). Recruitment deviations were also estimated are assumed to follow a lognormal distribution, where the standard deviation of this distribution is tuned as explained below.

Sensitivity scenarios and likelihood profiles (on $lnR_0$, steepness, and natural mortality) were used to explore uncertainty in the above model specifications and are reported below. 

### Data Weighting

The reference model allowed for the estimation of additional variance on all surveys except the taggin and OCNMS adult survey, both of which already had very high input variances. The ability to add variance to indices allows the model to balance model fit to that data while acknowledging that variances may be underestimated in the index standardization. A sensitivity was run with no extra variance estimated, as well as removal of the index data were explored.

Initial sample sizes for the commercial and recreational fleet length and conditional age-at-length compositions were based on the number of input effective samples sizes. The method of Francis [-@francis_data_2011], equation TA1.8, was then used to balance the length and conditional age-at-length composition data among other inputs and likelihood components. The Francis method treats mean length and age as indices, with effective sample size defining the variance around the mean. If the variability around the mean does not encompass model predictions, the data should be down-weighted until predictions fit within the intervals. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution), but can be sensitive to years that are outliers, as the amount of down-weighting is applied to all years within a data source, and are not year-specific. Sensitivities were performed examining different data-weighting treatments: 1) the Dirichlet-Multinomial approach [@thorson_model-based_2017], 2) the McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean approach [@mcallister_bayesian_1997], or 3) no data-weighting of lengths.


### Model Changes from the Last Assessment

Besides the additional of eight years of data and some changes in the estimation of some parameters, the biggest changes to the 2015 assessment are:

- Change in the removal history, especially the trawl fishery 3A catches from Astoria.
- Breaking the dockside survey into separate private and charter boat surveys. This allowed the ability to exclude years in the charter boat fishery that showed more effects from bag limits.
- Addition of the nearshore survey, and both OCNMS surveys.
