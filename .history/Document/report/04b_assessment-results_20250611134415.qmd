## Reference Model Diagnostics and Results


### Model Convergence and Acceptability {#model-convergence}

While there is no definitive measure of model convergence, several measures are routinely applied. These criteria include a low maximum gradient (`r model_output$maximum_gradient_component`), inversion of the Hessian (passed), acceptable fits to data (passed), and reasonable parameter values (passed). 

Model efficiency was explored by doing a short run Bayesian analysis using the Random Walk Metropolis with 2,000 draws, keeping all the draws and examining the fast mixing parameters. Those estimated parameters that do not move much from the initial values slow the model down and are recommended to be fixed at the starting value [@monnahan_overcoming_2019]. No additional parameters were fixed based on this analysis (@fig-pairs_plot_fast).

An extra effort was given to ensure the model did not rest on a local likelihood minimum. This was done by starting the minimization process from dispersed parameter values away from the maximum likelihood estimates to determine if the approach found a better model fit (i.e., minimum negative log-likelihood value). Starting parameters used a jitter shift value of 0.01 and 0.05. Both jitter scenarios were repeated 100 times with 78 out of 100 (jitter 0.01) and 49 out of 100 (jitter 0.05) runs returned to the reference model likelihood (@fig-jitter001 and @fig-jitter005). Out of the combined 200 jitter runs, a better fit, lower negative log-likelihood model was not found in any of the remaining runs. The reference model did not experience convergence issues when provided reasonable starting values. Through the jittering and likelihood profiles, the present reference model represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions.

### Fits to the Data


#### Lengths

Fits to the length data are examined based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The aggregate fit to each length composition demonstrates acceptable fits to each fleet and survey source (@fig-agg-len-fit). One noticeable behavior is the trade-off in fit between the fit in the bottom trawl fishery versus the fit in the at-sea-hake (ASHOP) fishery. This current model specification was the best trade off of fits between the two. 

Fits to the annual length composition are provided for the following fisheries and surveys:

<u>Fishery</u>

* Bottom trawl (@fig-len-fit-bt-1 and @fig-len-fit-bt-2)
* Bottom trawl discard (@fig-len-fit-btdis)
* Non-trawl (@fig-len-fit-nt-1 and @fig-len-fit-nt-2)
* Non-trawl discard (@fig-len-fit-ntdis)
* Midwater trawl (@fig-len-fit-midt)
* At-sea-hake (@fig-len-fit-ashop)

<u>Surveys</u>

* Triennial (@fig-len-fit-tri)
* Alaska slope (@fig-len-fit-akslope)
* West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl (@fig-len-fit-wcgbts)


Pearson residuals of fits to the fishery (@fig-peasrson-resids-fishery) and survey (@fig-peasrson-resids-survey) length data are reasonably small with no distinct patterns. 

Model fits to the mean lengths, assuming Francis data-weighting of 1 and blocking patterns, demonstrate fits within the error bars of most years and no strong residual patterns (@fig-meanlt-bt to @fig-meanlt-wcgbts). A notable observation in the means lengths within blocks generally show a lack of trend, not surprising given how many years an individual may be at its maximum size. This is in contrast with the age data that do show more nuances in age structure trend (see next section on age fits for more detail). This demonstrates the general lack of contrast in the length data.


### Ages

#### Conditional Age at Length

Fits to the sex-specific conditional age at length data are examined based on the age-at-length Pearson residuals, the annual mean ages, and mean age at length by year for the four fishery and one survey source. Pearson residuals were of reasonable size with no distinct patterns (@fig-peasrson-resids-age-bt1 to @fig-peasrson-resids-age-wcgbts3), as most of the residuals were small and not noteworthy and demonstrate the expected shape of the growth curve. There is more contrast in the age data compared to the length data (@fig-trawl-mean-caal to @fig-wcgbts-mean-caal). While the mean age for fisheries varied by gear selectivity (25-35 years for bottom trawl; 30-40 years for non-trawl; ~40 for midwater trawl; 40-50 years for the at-sea-hake fishery), one commonality was the increase in mean age in the last year of the model. This consistent increase in mean age across fisheries with different selectivities is important to remember when interpreting the retrospective pattern of the model. Mean age for the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl survey, which catch much smaller and less larger individuals, fluctuated around 20 and did not show an mean age increase in the final year. Fits to the mean ages by length bins show acceptable fits consistent with model expectations (@fig-call-plot-bt1 to @fig-call-plot-wcgbts6).

#### Marginal Age

Marginal age compositions are not fit in the model, but they are included in order to see how well they fit the reference model without influencing the likelihood (@fig-marage_bt to @fig-marage_wcgbts). Marginal length and age composition cannot be used in the same model because of the overlap of fish in both samples. This is why ages conditioned on lengths are often used with the length compositions. But it still stands that age compositions, instead of lengths, could be used. So adding the marginal age compositions passively (i.e., not contributing to the overall likelihood of the model) can offer insight into how consistent they are with the current model fit. Overall the realized fits are good.
