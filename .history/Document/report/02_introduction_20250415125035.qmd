# Introduction

This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) rockfishes, two species that form one management complex. This report is for the year 2025 in state and federal waters from California to Washington State, excluding consideration of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea (@fig-map). It seeks to use available catch, biological compositions in the for of lengths and ages, and potential indices of abundance.

## Stock Structure

There are at least two questions to think about when considering stock structure for Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes when doing a stock assessment.

1.  Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are two different species– can we separate them as two stocks and conduct separate assessments? 
Rougheye rockfish were first described in 1811 as *Perca variabilis* by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas [@jordan_fishes_1898], and assigned to various taxa at least 15 times since [@love_rockfishes_2002]. Some descriptions noted both light and dark color morphs, which, along with possible confusion with several morphologically similar co-occurring species (e.g., *S. borealis* and *S. melanostomus*) have contributed to the persistent ambiguity in formal descriptions of Rougheye Rockfish [@orr_species_2008]. The first genetic studies conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s [@tsuyuki_contribution_1968; @tsuyuki_analyses_1970] observed diversity suggestive of two genetic types within specimens identified as Rougheye Rockfish. Allozyme studies conducted over the next two decades [@seeb_biochemical_1986; @hawkins_genetic_1997; @hawkins_genetic_2005] provided additional evidence suggesting two separate genetic types within field-identified Rougheye Rockfish.  Genetic variation between the two types, supported by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, was determined to be sufficiently conclusive to separate two species: “Type I” and “Type II” Rougheye Rockfish [@gharrett_two_2005]. Meristic and morphometric comparisons of the two species suggested certain characters such as gill raker counts and length, snout length, anal base length, and pectoral fin base were significantly different, and in combination could reliably, though not definitively, distinguish between the species[@gharrett_genetically_2006].  The two separate species were formally re-described by @orr_species_2008 with the Type II group retaining *S. aleutianus* and the common name Rougheye Rockfish.  Blackspotted rockfish was proposed as the common name for the Type I group along with the scientific name of *S. melanostictus*, re-establishing nomenclature from one of the species complex’s earlier descriptions [@matsubara_1934].

These two species remain difficult to consistently differentiate visually in the catch, thus are still commonly reported and treated as a species complex. Otolith morphometrics (e.g., shape, size, weight) have shown some promise in possibly identifying these species in Alaskan waters (97.3% Blackspotted and 86.2% of Rougheye rockfishes were accurately identified) and possibly using older otoliths to break out historical information by species [@harris_using_2019]. Frey et al. (in prep.) provided insight into the ability of the Northwest Fisheries Science Center West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey biologists to identify the two species, with 90% of genetically identified Rougheye rockfish being correctly identified in the field. When mis-identifications occurred, it was usually a Blackspotted rockfish being mis-identified as a Rougheye rockfish. There were few mis-identifications when a fish was identified as a Blackspotted rockfish. While this is promising for potential future species-specific data coming from the survey, it does not alleviate the historical problem of separating fishery data into the two species. Frey et al. (in prep.) therefore also considered whether ecological factors like depth or latitude could help separate samples by species. They found that both species occur within the range of this assessment’s considered areas (California to Washington), and heavily spatially overlap. Interestingly, there seem to be relative hot spots for these species where one species is more common than the other, and in general, Rougheye rockfish seems to be more common than Blackspotted rockfish (however, Blackspotted rockfish may be the more common of the two in parts of Alaska). Overall, there seems to be little ability to separate current or historical fishery data reliably in order to separate these two species into two stocks, so we will maintain a species complex approach, though given absolute presence off the U.S. West coast, this may be considered more of a Rougheye than Blackspotted stock assessment. We also note that throughout the range of these stocks, all current assessments to this point have maintained a species complex approach.

Despite some identification advances and Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are clearly genetically distinct species, they remain most data historically and contemporaneously remain available only for the Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish complex, not at the species level. They both range from northern California up to and throughout Alaska. They both greatly overlap in latitude and depth, and are generally considered slope rockfish, with an ontogenetic shift from shallower to deeper, and adults commonly found at 360 m. Rougheye seems to be proportionally more abundant when survey samples are genetically identified, and Blackspotted tend to be found, on average, deeper than Rougheye. They can school and may segregate by size and age. While we treat these species as one assessed stock from this point forward, we recognize and are mindful of the above distinctions as we conduct our analyses.

2. Both species range into Canada and Alaska– are they one stock? While genetics studies have focused mostly on identification of the two species, little is known about the population structure of either species. This assessment and the 2013 assessment represent the most southerly range of these species. Comparing the absolute abundance of the 2013 assessment to the most current estimates of the Alaskan stocks, the absolute number in this southerly range is much smaller than in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), but higher than the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island (BSAI) stock (@fig-SO_comp). The two smaller stocks have similar trend of decline and stabilization, whereas the higher biomass GOA stock looks to have not dropped at all over the time period considered (@fig-RSS_comp).


  These two species may hybridize on occasion (Love 2011).  These species are closely related to shortraker rockfish (S. borealis) and are sometimes difficult to distinguish from shortraker rockfish without looking at the gill rakers.  



## Life History Information

Rougheye and blackspotted rockfish share broad overlap in their depth and geographic distributions from the Eastern Aleutian Islands along the North American continental margin to southern Oregon, with blackspotted rockfish’s range extending east beyond the Aleutian chain to the Pacific Coast of Japan (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Both species are encountered at depths shallower than 100 m to at least 439 m, however, blackspotted rockfish tend to be more prevalent in deeper waters (Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Genetic information is not available to provide positive species identification in historical survey and landings information, but these data indicate that density of the nominal rougheye rockfish complex decreases sharply south of the Oregon-California border (42° N).  Studies suggest that rougheye rockfish account for a greater proportion of the species complex along the coast of Washington and Oregon than in Alaskan waters (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Recent discussions with port samplers in southern Oregon suggest that both rougheye and blackspotted rockfish are encountered with some regularity in the commercial trawl and fixed-gear landings in Charleston, Port Orford, and Brookings, with blackspotted rockfish composing approximately one third to one half of identified specimens (C. Good and N. Wilsman, ODFW, pers. comm.).

The west coast of the U.S. is the southern portion of the range of rougheye rockfish, and it is likely that the population north of the U.S.-Canada border is not a separate stock.  The connectivity of rougheye populations throughout its range is unknown.

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->
