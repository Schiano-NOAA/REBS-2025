## Characterizing uncertainty
### Sensitivity Analyses {#sec-assmt-sens}
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model sensitivity to alternative data treatment and model specifications.

#### Data treatment sensitivities

Data treatments explored the removal of data types (indices and biological compositions), data weighting options and ageing error treatment. 

##### Removal of data sources 

The following data source sensitivities were explored:
- Remove a single index of abundance (Triennial, Alaska slope, NW slope, WCGBTS, all indices)
- For each fleet and index, including discard fleets, removal of length composition data
- For each fleet and the WCGBTS, removal of age composition data

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data source removal sensitivity are available in @tbl-sensitivities-like-indices to @tbl-sensitivities-like-age. Additionally, time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in @fig-sens_indices_spout to @fig-sens_age_relsp. Derived quantities relative of all data removal sensitivities to the reference model are summarized in @fig-sens_sum_data. Generally, the removal of indices of abundance decreased both the spawning output and the relative spawning output as compared to the base model (@fig-sens_indices_spout and @fig-sens_indices_relsp). Of these, the WCGBTS appears to have the most significant impact. Removal of the bottom trawl (bottom trawl + discards) and non-trawl (non-trawl + discards) fishery length compositions decreased the spawning output and the relative spawning output, whereas removal of the mid-water trawl and the at-sea hake length compositions increased the spawning output and relative spawning output (@fig-sens_lens1_spout and @fig-sens_lens1_relsp). Of the length composition removals, the most influential data sources appear to be the fishery fleets and removal of the survey length compositions had a limited impact on both spawning output and relative spawning output compared to the base model (@fig-sens_lens2_spout and @fig-sens_lens2_relsp). Finally, the removal of any age composition data source decreased the spawning output, with the exception of the mid-water trawl ages, and decreased the relative spawning output (@fig-sens_age_spout and @fig-sens_age_relsp). Again, the WCGBTS appears to be the most influential of the data sources with age composition information.

  	
##### Data weighting

The following data weighting sensitivities were explored:
- No data-weighting
- Dirichlet data-weighting
- McAllister-Ianelli data weighting

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data source removal sensitivity are available in . Comparison plots for the results relative to the reference model are in @fig-sensi-data-wt and @fig-sensi-RE-data-wt. Each data weighting scenario up-weighted the influence of the length data relative to the age data. This resulted in a large drop in the stock scale, but little change in the high stock status. These changes were within the uncertainty of the base model, though at the low end for the stock scale.


##### Ageing error

The following ageing error sensitivities were explored:
  - No Ageing error for all sources (unbiased and precise ages)
  - No ageing error for each source at a time

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each data source removal sensitivity are available in 


Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters and derived quantities from each sensitivity are available in Table . Derived quantities relative to the reference model are provided in Figure . Time series of spawning output and relative spawning output are shown in Figures  and .

#### Model Specification Sensitivities {#senstivities}
Model specifications looked at the estimation of individual and combinations of life history parameters, the estimation of recruitment, and the treatment of fecundity and selectivity. All scenarios match the reference model specifications in all other aspects unless otherwise stated.

- Life history estimation
	- Natural mortality ($M$)
		1. Estimate $M$
		2. Lorenzen age varying $M$
		3. Use Oregon 2023 assessment sex-specific M values (females = 0.19; males = 0.17)
		4. Maintain sex ratio in age and length data (sex option 3) and estimate $M$
	
	- Growth parameters
	 	6. Fix all growth parameters to external values
	 	5. Fix all growth parameters to external values, estimate $M$
		7. Estimate $L_min$
	 	8. Fix $t_0$ = 0
	 	9. Estimate $CV_{young}$ and $CV_{old}$
	
	- Reproductive Biology
	
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impacts of including different reproductive biology data and parameterization in the assessment. We examined using proportional fecundity to weight (instead of an exponential relationship), functional maturity at age (instead of length), functional maturity at length for Blackspotted Rockfish (instead of all data available for the complex), functional maturity at length for Rougheye Rockfish (instead of all data available for the complex), and biological maturity at length for the complex (instead of functional maturity at length for the complex). Summaries of the model results for these sensitivities are presented in **Table X** and **Figure X**. Model output showed that the base model was most sensitive to using maturity at age instead of maturity at length, with a decrease in relative depletion from the 1970’s to 1990’s using maturity at age. For this long-lived species, age may be a more precise determination of maturity (because there is a wide range of lengths per age); however, age data is more limited. The base model was less sensitive to the other changes, with similar output between the base and alternative models.

	- Recruitment estimation
	 	13. No recruitment estimation
	 	14. Estimate recruitment for all years in the model

### Likelihood Profiles


### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model and sequentially removing one year of data up through minus 5 years. Retrospective spawning output (Figure ) and relatives stock status (Figure ) estimates show a generally consistent pattern in population scale and trend, within the error of the reference model. All models show the population increasing. This results in a stock status in the precautionary zone over the 5 year consideration. The Mohn's rho evaluation of the degree of retrospective pattern in given in Table  and shown in Figure . The relative error in the data peels are below significant levels. 


### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

There are no major unresolved problems in the stock assessment, but there are many sources of uncertainty. Natural mortality remains a large source of uncertainty. The estimation of growth also required fixing certain parameters, leading to an underestimation of uncertainty in the model. The stock-recruit relationship is assumed to be a Beverton-Holt relationship with a fixed steepness of 0.72. Large uncertainty was shown if the nature of this relationship varies either deterministically or over time. The full time series of recruitment deviations were not informed, which creates some historical and contemporary uncertainty. Likewise, all life history values are assumed constant, so any time-varying issues that are directional could create more uncertainty.
