# Data

Data from a wide range of programs were available for possible inclusion in the current
assessment model. Descriptions of each data source included in the model (Figure ) and
sources that were explored but not included in the base model are provided below. Data
that were excluded from the base model were excluded only after being explicitly explored
during the development of this stock assessment and found to be inappropriate for use or
had not changed since their past exploration for previous `r spp` stock assessments
when they were not used.

## Fishery-dependent data

<!-- Commercial fisheries landings by state, year, and gear (PacFIN is the standard source for recent domestic commercial landings), historical catch estimates, discards, recreational fisheries catches, foreign removals; sample size information for length- and age-composition data by state, year and gear, including both the number of trips and fish sampled. Description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information by survey and year. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction. -->

### Biological data

#### Length and Age Sample Sizes

##### Multinomial Sample Sizes

Initial input values for the multinomial samples sizes determine the relative weights applied in fitting the annual composition data within the set of observations for each fishing fleet in the model.  The initial input values in this assessment were based on the following equation developed by I. Stewart and S. Miller (NWFSC), and presented at the 2006 Stock Assessment Data and Modeling workshop. The input sample sizes for all commercial data were calculated based on a combination of trips and fish sampled:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}

## Biological Parameters


### Natural Mortality



\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

\vspace{0.5cm}

where $M$ is natural mortality and ${A_{\text{max}}}$ is the assumed maximum age. The prior is defined as a lognormal distribution with mean $ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and standard error = 0.31.



### Age and Growth Relationship

\begin{centering}

Females $L_{\infty}$ =  cm; $k$ =  per year; $t_0$ = 

Males $L_{\infty}$ =  cm; $k$ =  per year; $t_0$ = 

\end{centering}

### Ageing Bias and Precision



### Length-Weight Relationship
Female and male length-weight relationships were determined using data from the PacFIN database, West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey, and ASHOP samples. Samples size by sex were: female (N=13839), males (13625), and unknown sex (53). Each of the data sources estimated very similar length-weight relationships (@fig-LW1).

The resultant sex-specific length-weight relationships are given in @fig-LW2, with the following individual values: 

* Females: W = 0.000008L^3.15
* Males: W = 0.000012L^3.07

These values are very similar to the previous assessment that used a combine sex value of a=0.0000096 and b=3.12000 (@fig-LW2).


### Maturity
An updated maturity analysis for the Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish complex with additional samples to estimate the length at which 50% of females in the population are mature (L50) is completed. Biological maturity identifies females that are physiologically capable of spawning. Functional maturity identifies females that are physiologically capable of spawning and will likely spawn in a given year. The most recent L50 estimate (not yet updated) of biological maturity is 43.84 cm and the most recent L50 estimate (not yet updated) of functional maturity is 48.44 cm.


### Fecundity
The 2013 U.S. west coast stock assessment assumed that fecundity was proportional to weight. Dick et al. (2017) provided a study on rockfishes showing that rockfishes routinely have a non-proportional relationship of fecundity to weight, with larger individuals producing more eggs than expected only by weight. Neither Rougheye or Blackspotted rockfishes have a species- of subfamily-specific estimate for this relationship, so this stock assessment uses the unobserved Genus Sebastes values of a = 6.538e-06 and b = 4.043 using the F=aL^b relationship.

### Stock-Recruitment Function and Compensation
The Beverton-Holt stock recruit relationship is assumed, as it was in the 2013 assessment, to describe the relationship between spawning biomass and recruitment. The steepness parameter may be considered for estimation, but it is notoriously difficult to estimate in assessment models. The 2013 stock assessment used the previous rockfish steepness mean value of 0.77, but this has subsequently been updated to 0.72, to a value that represents a stock with somewhat lower recruitment compensation. Natural variation in recruitment (i.e., not deterministically taken from the stock-recruit curve) is apparent in the length and age data (as notable length or age classes growing/ageing over time), so deviations in recruitment will be estimated.

### Sex Ratio

No information on the sex ratio at birth was available so it was assumed to be 50:50. 

## Environmental and ecosystem data

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors or environmental factors into the assessment model. More predation, diet and habitat work, and mechanistic linkages to environmental conditions would be needed to incorporate these elements into the stock assessment and should remain a priority. @McClure:2023:VCC report the climate vulnerability for several west coast groundfishes, including `r spp`. `r Spp` demonstrated both high biological sensitivity and high climate exposure risk, to give it an overall high vulnerability score to climate change. This result should also be considered with the fact that, like many rockfishes, periods of low productivity is not unusual to `r spp` and their extended longevity (though admittedly this seems shorter than previously believed and should be reconsidered) has historically allowed them to wait for advantageous productivity periods. Stressors such as habitat degradation and climate change could bring significant challenges to population sustainability. Regardless, no environmental or ecosystem data are directly incorporated into the stock assessment model.
