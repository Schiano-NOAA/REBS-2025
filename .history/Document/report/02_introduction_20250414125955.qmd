# Introduction

This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) rockfishes, two species that form one management complex. This report is for the year 2025 in state and federal waters from California to Washington State, excluding consideration of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea. It seeks to use available catch, biological compositions in the for of lengths and ages, and potential indices of abundance.

## Stock Structure

Rougheye rockfish were first described in 1811 as *Perca variabilis* by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas (Jordan and Evermann 1898), and assigned to various taxa at least 15 times since (Love et al. 2002).  Some descriptions noted both light and dark color morphs, which, along with possible confusion with several morphologically similar co-occurring species (e.g., S. borealis and S. melanostomus) have contributed to the persistent ambiguity in formal descriptions of Rougheye Rockfish (Orr and Hawkins 2008).  The first genetic studies conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s (e.g., Tsuyuki et al. 1968, Tsuyuki and Westrheim 1970) observed diversity suggestive of two genetic types within specimens identified as Rougheye Rockfish.  Allozyme studies conducted over the next two decades (e.g., Seeb 1986, Hawkins et al. 1997, Hawkins et al. 2005) provided additional evidence suggesting two separate genetic types within field-identified Rougheye Rockfish.  Genetic variation between the two types, supported by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, was determined to be sufficiently conclusive to separate two species: “Type I” and “Type II” Rougheye Rockfish (Gharrett et al. 2005).  Meristic and morphometric comparisons of the two species suggested certain characters such as gill raker counts and length, snout length, anal base length, and pectoral fin base were significantly different, and in combination could reliably, though not definitively, distinguish between the species (Gharrett et al. 2006).  The two separate species were formally re-described by Orr and Hawkins (2008) with the Type II group retaining *S. aleutianus* and the common name Rougheye Rockfish.  Blackspotted rockfish was proposed as the common name for the Type I group along with the scientific name of *S. melanostictus*, re-establishing nomenclature from one of the species complex’s earlier descriptions (cf. Matsubara 1934).

Though Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are genetically distinct, they remain difficult to visually distinguish, thus most data historically and contemporaneously are only available for the Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish complex, not at the species level. They both range from northern California up to and throughout Alaska. They both greatly overlap in latitude and depth, and are generally considered slope rockfish, with an otogentic shift from shallower to deeper, and adults commonly found at 360 m. Rougheye seems to be proportionally more abundant when survey samples are genetically identified, and Blackspotted tend to be found, on average, deeper than Rougheye. They can school and may segregate by size and age. While we treat these species as one assessed stock from this point forward, we recognize and are mindful of the above distinctions as we conduct our analyses.




are a long-lived rockfish named after a series of 2–10 spines along the lower rim of their eyes.  They have also been called blackthroat or blacktip rockfish (Love et al. 2002, Love 2011).  Recently, Gharrett et al. (2005) and Hawkins et al. (2005) described two sympatric species with similar characteristics, rougheye rockfish and blackspotted rockfish (S. melanostictus), although S. melanostictus was first described in the 1930’s (Orr and Hawkins 2008).  These two species may hybridize on occasion (Love 2011).  These species are closely related to shortraker rockfish (S. borealis) and are sometimes difficult to distinguish from shortraker rockfish without looking at the gill rakers.  



## Life History Information



Rougheye and blackspotted rockfish share broad overlap in their depth and geographic distributions from the Eastern Aleutian Islands along the North American continental margin to southern Oregon, with blackspotted rockfish’s range extending east beyond the Aleutian chain to the Pacific Coast of Japan (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Both species are encountered at depths shallower than 100 m to at least 439 m, however, blackspotted rockfish tend to be more prevalent in deeper waters (Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Genetic information is not available to provide positive species identification in historical survey and landings information, but these data indicate that density of the nominal rougheye rockfish complex decreases sharply south of the Oregon-California border (42° N).  Studies suggest that rougheye rockfish account for a greater proportion of the species complex along the coast of Washington and Oregon than in Alaskan waters (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Recent discussions with port samplers in southern Oregon suggest that both rougheye and blackspotted rockfish are encountered with some regularity in the commercial trawl and fixed-gear landings in Charleston, Port Orford, and Brookings, with blackspotted rockfish composing approximately one third to one half of identified specimens (C. Good and N. Wilsman, ODFW, pers. comm.).

The west coast of the U.S. is the southern portion of the range of rougheye rockfish, and it is likely that the population north of the U.S.-Canada border is not a separate stock.  The connectivity of rougheye populations throughout its range is unknown.



## Life History

<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, catch rates, or discards).

## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->


## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Council’s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->
