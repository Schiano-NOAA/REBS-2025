# Executive Summary

## Stock Description
This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes, two species that form one management complex. Despite some identification advances and Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are clearly genetically distinct species, data historically and contemporaneously remain available mostly for the Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish complex, not consistently at the species level.  While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses. This report is for the year 2025 in state and federal waters from California to Washington State, excluding consideration of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea (@fig-map). It seeks to use available catch, biological compositions in the for of lengths and ages, and potential indices of abundance and is the first assessment since the 2013 stock assessment [@hicks_status_2013].


## Catches
`r Spp` are mainly incidentally caught and retained, and caught mainly by trawl (both bottom and midwater) and non-trawl (largely hook and line gear) in commercial fisheries (@fig-es-landings). The non-trawl removals were dominate until the 1960s were trawl-caught `r spp` increased. The biggest removals were reported in the 1980s and came from the trawl fishery, but the most recent largest catches come from the at-sea-hake fishery (@tbl-es-catches). Discards are generally thought to be negligible to low for most fo the time series.

### Data and Assessments
The only previous stock assessment for `r spp` for the west coast area was done in 2013. This assessment separates the discard catches from the retained fisheries, maintains the at-sea-hake fishery as its own fishery, and adds a midwater fishery that has emerged in the last 10 years. This stock assessment adds 10+ years of additional length data, and adds several more years of age data (included as conditioned on length data). The same four groundfish abundance surveys (Triennial, Alaska Slope, Northwest Fishery Science Center Slope, and the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS)) as used in the last stock assessment are used here, with an extension to 2024 to the the WCGBTS. The index standardization of all survey data uses the newer approach of applying spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models. 

### Stock Output and Dynamics
The model estimates that the population , but increased through the 2000s to mid 2010s (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl). Since 2017 (coincident with the increase in catches), spawning output has been gradually declining, but is still well above the management target of 40% of unfished spawning depletion (@tbl-es-sb).

## Recruitment
The estimated largest recruitment event throughout the time series was in 2008, which supported an increase in the population leading up to 2017 (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits). Recruitment is estimated to be relatively low in the later 2010s, but the model estimates that 2021 and 2023 may support large year classes in the future, with the estimates driven by the new recruitment index for both years.

## Exploitation Status
Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a spawning potential ratio of 0.5 throughout the entire time series. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to restrictive trip limits. As with catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017, have remained stable since then, and are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).

## Ecosysystem Consideration
The assessment includes a sensitivity model with an oceanographic recruitment index. A number of ecosystem and environmental conditions were compiled by a team of ecosystem scientists at the NWFSC specific to the life history and distribution of northern yellowtail. These conditions included an evaluation of oceanographic conditions impacting recruitment, habitat change, prey availability, predator and competitor abundance, and climate vulnerability. 


## Reference Points
A list of estimates of the current state of the population, as well as reference points based on 1) a target unfished spawning output of 40%, 2) a spawning potential ratio of 0.5, and 3) the model estimate of maximum sustainable yield, are all listed in @tbl-ref-points-es. SPR, or the spawning potential ratio, is the fraction of expected lifetime reproductive output under a given fishing intensity divided by unfished expected lifetime reproductive output.

## Management Performance
Although catch increased substantially in 2017, it has still been well below the overfishing limit, allowable biological catch, and annual catch limit (@tbl-es-management). Attainment of the OFL has averaged around 50\% since the increase in landings, and was even lower in prior years.

#| echo: false
#| eval: !expr eval_tables

```


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty
The largest uncertainty in this model is the inability to fit a marked increase in the bottom trawl survey from 2014-2019. This coincides with an increase in catch-per-unit-effort from the midwater trawl fishery (which accounts for the majority of landings). The increase is likely due to the record 2008 year class, but the estimated size of the year class does not lead to a large enough increase to fit the survey index, and it is especially hard to fit the sudden decrease and then flattening of the index, given the estimated natural mortality rate and that catches were relatively stable from 2017-2024. The current assessment estimates that the stock is more depleted than it was in 2017, the time of the last assessment, which is likely the case. The magnitude of that difference is more uncertain.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables
Projections of the overfishing limit, acceptable biological catch, and annual catch limit, all based on a P* of 0.45 and a log-space standard deviation of the overfishing limit of 0.5 are included in @tbl-es-projections. Assumed catches for 2025 and 2026 for this projection were provided by the Groundfish Management Team, and catches from 2027 onward assume full attainment of the acceptable biological catch.
