# Introduction

This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (Sebastes aleutianus) and Blackspotted (Sebastes melanostictus) rockfishes complex at the beginning of the year 2025 for state and federal waters from California to Alaska.  

 are a long-lived rockfish named after a series of 2–10 spines along the lower rim of their eyes.  They have also been called blackthroat or blacktip rockfish (Love et al. 2002, Love 2011).  Recently, Gharrett et al. (2005) and Hawkins et al. (2005) described two sympatric species with similar characteristics, rougheye rockfish and blackspotted rockfish (S. melanostictus), although S. melanostictus was first described in the 1930’s (Orr and Hawkins 2008).  These two species may hybridize on occasion (Love 2011).  These species are closely related to shortraker rockfish (S. borealis) and are sometimes difficult to distinguish from shortraker rockfish without looking at the gill rakers.  

Blackspotted rockfish are distributed in similar locations as rougheye rockfish and it is very difficult to visually distinguish the two species.  It has only been from recent genetic studies that these two separate species have been identified (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005) and have had phenotypic characteristics useful for identifying the species in the field identified (Gharrett et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Before then, data are available for one species called rougheye rockfish which included rougheye rockfish and blackspotted rockfish.  Due to the difficulty in distinguishing these two species and the lack of historical separation of the species in all of the data, this assessment combines any data for blackspotted rockfish with rougheye rockfish and provides management advice for the two species combined.  In this assessment, the term “rougheye rockfish” refers to rougheye/blackspotted rockfish unless specified.

Therefore, this assessment is focused on the population of rougheye and blackspotted rockfishes on the outer West Coast of the United States.  This includes waters off of California, Oregon, and Washington, but does not include Puget Sound or Canadian waters ().  

Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes. These two species, together, are treated as a combined species complex. Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are genetically distinct, but difficult to visually distinguish, thus most data are only available for the Rougheye/Blackspotted rockfish complex, not at the species level. They range from northern California up to and throughout Alaska. They both greatly overlap in latitude and depth, and are generally considered slope rockfish, with an otogentic shift from shallower to deeper, and adults commonly found at 360 m. Rougheye seems to be proportionally more abundant when survey samples are genetically identified, and Blackspotted tend to be found, on average, deeper than Rougheye. They can school and may segregate by size and age. While we treat these species as one assessed stock from this point forward, we recognize and are mindful of the above distinctions as we conduct our analyses.

## Basic Information

The earliest description of what would come to be known as rougheye rockfish date to 1811 with the identification of Perca variabilis by German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas (Jordan and Evermann 1898).  It has subsequently been described and assigned to various taxa at least 15 times (Love et al. 2002).  Some descriptions noted both light and dark color morphs, which, along with possible confusion with several morphologically similar co-occurring species (e.g., S. borealis and S. melanostomus) have contributed to the persistent ambiguity in formal descriptions of rougheye rockfish (Orr and Hawkins 2008).  The first genetic studies conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s (e.g., Tsuyuki et al. 1968, Tsuyuki and Westrheim 1970) observed diversity suggestive of two genetic types within specimens identified as rougheye rockfish.  Allozyme studies conducted over the next two decades (e.g., Seeb 1986, Hawkins et al. 1997, Hawkins et al. 2005) provided additional evidence suggesting two separate genetic types within field-identified rougheye rockfish.  Genetic variation between the two types, as manifested by divergence within both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, was determined to be sufficiently conclusive of two separate species by Gharrett et al. (2005) which proposed a delineation of “Type I” and “Type II” rougheye rockfish.  Meristic and morphometric comparisons of the two species suggested certain characters such as gill raker counts and length, snout length, anal base length, and pectoral fin base were significantly different, and in combination could reliably, though not definitively, distinguish between the species (Gharrett et al. 2006).  The two separate species were formally re-described by Orr and Hawkins (2008) with the Type II group retaining the rougheye rockfish common name and S. aleutianus taxon.  Blackspotted rockfish was proposed as the common name for the Type I group along with the scientific name of S. melanostictus, re-establishing nomenclature from one of the species complex’s earlier descriptions (cf. Matsubara 1934).

Rougheye and blackspotted rockfish share broad overlap in their depth and geographic distributions from the Eastern Aleutian Islands along the North American continental margin to southern Oregon, with blackspotted rockfish’s range extending east beyond the Aleutian chain to the Pacific Coast of Japan (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Both species are encountered at depths shallower than 100 m to at least 439 m, however, blackspotted rockfish tend to be more prevalent in deeper waters (Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Genetic information is not available to provide positive species identification in historical survey and landings information, but these data indicate that density of the nominal rougheye rockfish complex decreases sharply south of the Oregon-California border (42° N).  Studies suggest that rougheye rockfish account for a greater proportion of the species complex along the coast of Washington and Oregon than in Alaskan waters (Gharrett et al. 2005, Hawkins et al. 2005, Orr and Hawkins 2008).  Recent discussions with port samplers in southern Oregon suggest that both rougheye and blackspotted rockfish are encountered with some regularity in the commercial trawl and fixed-gear landings in Charleston, Port Orford, and Brookings, with blackspotted rockfish composing approximately one third to one half of identified specimens (C. Good and N. Wilsman, ODFW, pers. comm.).

The west coast of the U.S. is the southern portion of the range of rougheye rockfish, and it is likely that the population north of the U.S.-Canada border is not a separate stock.  The connectivity of rougheye populations throughout its range is unknown.



## Life History

<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->

## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->


## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Council’s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->
