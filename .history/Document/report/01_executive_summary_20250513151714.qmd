# Executive Summary

## Stock Description
This document presents the stock assessment for the Rougheye (*Sebastes aleutianus*) and Blackspotted (*Sebastes melanostictus*) Rockfishes, two species that form one management complex. Despite some identification advances and Rougheye and Blackspotted rockfishes are clearly genetically distinct species, data historically and contemporaneously remain available mostly for the Rougheye/Blackspotted Rockfish complex, not consistently at the species level.  While we treat these species as one assessed stock complex, we recognize and are mindful of the above species distinctions as we conduct our analyses. This report is for the year 2025 in state and federal waters from California to Washington State, excluding consideration of the Puget Sound and Salish Sea (@fig-map). It seeks to use available catch, biological compositions in the for of lengths and ages, and potential indices of abundance and is the first assessment since the 2013 stock assessment [@hicks_status_2013].


## Catches
`r Spp` are mainly incidentally caught and retained, and caught mainly by trawl (both bottom and midwater) and non-trawl (largely hook and line gear) in commercial fisheries (@fig-es-landings). The non-trawl removals were dominate until the 1960s were trawl-caught `r spp` increased. The biggest removals were reported in the 1980s and came from the trawl fishery, but the most recent largest catches come from the at-sea-hake fishery (@tbl-es-catches). Discards are generally thought to be negligible to low for most fo the time series.

### Data and Assessments
The only previous stock assessment for `r spp` for the west coast area was done in 2013. This assessment separates the discard catches from the retained fisheries, maintains the at-sea-hake fishery as its own fishery, and adds a midwater fishery that has emerged in the last 10 years. This stock assessment adds 10+ years of additional length data, and adds several more years of age data (included as conditioned on length data). The same four groundfish abundance surveys (Triennial, Alaska Slope, Northwest Fishery Science Center Slope, and the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS)) as used in the last stock assessment are used here, with an extension to 2024 to the the WCGBTS. The index standardization of all survey data uses the newer approach of applying spatiotemporal generalized linear mixed models. 

### Stock Output and Dynamics
The model estimates that the population , but increased through the 2000s to mid 2010s (@fig-es-sb, @fig-es-depl). Since 2017 (coincident with the increase in catches), spawning output has been gradually declining, but is still well above the management target of 40% of unfished spawning depletion (@tbl-es-sb).

```

## Recruitment
The estimated largest recruitment event throughout the time series was in 2008, which supported an increase in the population leading up to 2017 (@tbl-es-recr, @fig-es-recruits). Recruitment is estimated to be relatively low in the later 2010s, but the model estimates that 2021 and 2023 may support large year classes in the future, with the estimates driven by the new recruitment index for both years.

## Exploitation Status
Exploitation rates were below the management target of a fishing intensity that leads to a spawning potential ratio of 0.5 throughout the entire time series. They decreased and were close to zero in the early 2000s due to restrictive trip limits. As with catches, exploitation rates increased substantially in 2017, have remained stable since then, and are still well below the management target (@tbl-es-spr, @fig-es-kobe).
